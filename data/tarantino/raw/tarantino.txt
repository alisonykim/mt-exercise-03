               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but –

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         – but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         – yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl – the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)
                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you

               INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front 
               seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both 
               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                         – Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause – get a load of 
                         this – if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT
                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES
                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                                     JULES
                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses – nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                         – no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages – I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage – 
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed – this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be –

                                     JULES
                         – I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions –

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black –

                                     JULES
                         – go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald –

                                     JULES
                         – does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find – when all 
                         this shit is over and done – I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
                         motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
                         now you got ability. But painful as 
                         it may be, ability don't last. Now 
                         that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
                         life, but it's a fact of life your 
                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you 
                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 
                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Now the night of the fight, you may 
                         fell a slight sting, that's pride 
                         fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride 
                         only hurts, it never helps. Fight 
                         through that shit. 'Cause a year 
                         from now, when you're kickin' it in 
                         the Caribbean you're gonna say, 
                         "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                     BUTCH
                         I got no problem with that.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         In the fifth, your ass goes down.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

               CLOSEUP – JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

                                     LANCE
                         Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 
                         good stuff. This is Bava, different, 
                         but equally good. And this is Choco 
                         from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 
                         Now the first two are the same, forty-
                         five an ounce – those are friend 
                         prices – but this one...
                              (pointing to the Choco)
                         ...this one's a little more expensive.  
                         It's fifty-five. But when you shoot 
                         it, you'll know where that extra 
                         money went.  Nothing wrong with the 
                         first two. It's real, real, real, 
                         good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 
                         madman.

                         No.  You're in my house. White people 
                         who know the difference between good 
                         shit and bad shit, this is the house

                         dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT

                         man should love it.

                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA
                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                                     VINCENT
                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY

                         Did you just order a five-dollar 
                         shake?

                                     MIA
                         Sure did.

                                     VINCENT
                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh.

                                     VINCENT
                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him –

                                     MIA
                         What are you doing?

                                     VINCENT
                         Rollin' a smoke.

                                     MIA
                         Here?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it –

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist – when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                                     MIA
                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding 
                         – then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mia holds her hand.

                         Right here.

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that 
                         trophy.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP – MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                                     PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
                              (on TV)
                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         I can hear it!

                         I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna

               VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
               conversation.

                                     VINCENT

                         phone?

                                     VINCENT

                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

                         What the hell was that?

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
               lawn.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia

                         instead you let her die on your front 
                         lawn.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

                                     JODY
                         It's only one-thirty in the goddamn 
                         mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on 
                         out here?

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                     JODY
                         Who's she?

               Lance looks up at Jody.

                         What's wrong with her?

                         She's ODing on us.

               She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking 
               for the shot.

               WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                     VINCENT

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

                         I'm looking as fast as I can!

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                                     JODY

                         I never saw a medical book.

                         Well if it's that important, why 
                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                                     LANCE
                         I don't know! Stop bothering me!

                                     JODY
                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room –

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         – get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                                     VINCENT
                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE
                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

                         – that.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest – SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                                     MIA
                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                     JODY
                         Anybody want a beer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Mia!

               She turns around.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                                     VINCENT
                         What are your thoughts on how to 
                         handle this?

                                     MIA
                         What's yours?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA
                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                                     VINCENT
                         I seriously doubt that.

                                     MIA
                         If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                     VINCENT
                         Let's shake on it.

               The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to 
               shake and shake they do.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mum's the word.

               Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
               evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home 
                         and have a heart attack.

               Mia giggles.

               Vincent turns to leave.

                                     MIA
                         You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE 
                         FIVE" joke?

               Vincent turns around.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's 
                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                                     VINCENT
                         I can't wait.

                                     MIA
                         Three tomatoes are walking down the 
                         street, a poppa tomato, a momma 
                         tomato, and a little baby tomato. 
                         The baby tomato is lagging behind 
                         the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa 
                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the 
                         momma tomato and stamps on him –
                              (stamps on the ground)
                         – and says: catch up.

               They both smile, but neither laugh.

                                     MIA
                         See ya 'round, Vince.

               Mia turns and walks inside her house.

               CLOSEUP – VINCENT

               After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where 
               she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a 
               kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu 
               START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

               OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Butch.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE
                         It's time, Butch.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

                         ...Coolidge was out of there faster 
                         than I've ever seen a victorious 
                         boxer vacate the ring. Do you think 
                         he knew Willis was dead?

                                     SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I 
                         think any man would've left the ring 
                         that fast.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

               Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named 
               ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, 
               sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a 
               white styrofoam cup.

               The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

                         Do you feel this ring death tragedy 
                         will have an effect on the world of 
                         boxing?

                                     SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
                         Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't 
                         help but shake the world of boxing 
                         to its very foundation. But it's of 
                         paramount importance that during the 
                         sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the 
                         W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

               CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (Spanish accent)
                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Where to?

                                     BUTCH
                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mia. How you doin'?

                                     MIA
                         Great. I never thanked you for the 
                         dinner.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – 
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio – you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man –

                                     BUTCH
                         – I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news – I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese –

                                     BUTCH
                         – where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         –

                                     BUTCH
                         – on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table – on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY – DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA – DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA – DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         –

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me –

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         – hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business –

                                     MAYNARD
                         – I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

               TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask – two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good –

                                     BUTCH
                         – did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk – 
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the

                         You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT (O.S.)
                         Yes!

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM – DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT – DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand –

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     JULES
                         Don't blaspheme!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules –

                                     JULES
                         – I said don't do that –

                                     VINCENT
                         – you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in 
                         my time –

                                     VINCENT
                         – chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight –

                                     VINCENT
                         – I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin' 
                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT
                         Who ya callin'?

                                     JULES
                         A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's Toluca Lake.

                                     JULES
                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie –

                                     JIMMIE
                         – I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him –

                                     JIMMIE
                         – answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                         – I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation – 
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie –

                                     JIMMIE
                         – don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery – now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie – 
                         lead the way, boys – get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE – MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless –

                                     THE WOLF
                         – unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                                     JULES
                         We cool?

                                     WINSTON
                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT
                         Redondo Beach.

                                     JULES
                         Inglewood.

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ –

                                     VINCENT
                         – what happened was peculiar – no 
                         doubt about it – but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all –

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
                         general principle.

                                     JULES
                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
               – wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END

          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among

          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second

          are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
          front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
          shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
          As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

          Tony?

<b>                         DJANGO

          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.

          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to

          well. Good job Django, well done.

          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          that man. After I've killed him, I transport
          that man's corpse back to the authorities -
          and sometimes that's easier said then done.

          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.

          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.

          of the criminal justice system of the
          United States of America. The man to my
          left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
          In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
          court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
          Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
          alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          Roger Brittle --

<b>                         DJANGO

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.

          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.

          lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.

          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          To say the least.
          (stopping the horse)
          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

<b>                         TIME CUT

<b>          EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
</b>          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
          Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          cup of tea.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes there is.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Do you know it?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          What she do.?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like blow up.
          He pantomimes a explosion.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Does Sigfried save her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
          He walks through hellfire because
          Broomhilda's worth. it.
          After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
          as they nibble on their sandwiches.

<b>                         DJANGO

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I think I'm just starting to realize that.
          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
          thinks about what he's going to say next.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

<b>                         DJANGO

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

<b>                         DJANGO

          Big John and Rodger?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          What'd ya mean partner up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

<b>                         DJANGO

<b>                         W7
</b>          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes. You work with me through the winter,
          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
          Django accepts that response.
          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

<b>                         WE SEE

          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          to be good at this.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.

          "That one", Schultz says.
          Django RIPS IT off the wall.
          As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
          hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

          practices his fast draw against five men...
          .by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
          DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
          falls to the ground to get the fifth.
          He looks up from the ground at Schultz.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You're pretty confident aren't you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You have reason to be.
          He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
          All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          top of Django.

          Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
          sure.
          He blows out the match...

<b>          WE GO TO BLACK

          slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
          steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
          He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

          Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
          Greenville operates.
          As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
          MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
          Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
          The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
          Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
          outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
          wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
          Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE

          The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES

          Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
          Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

          WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
          the leg irons scrap her ankles.
          Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
          in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
          perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
          Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
          to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
          Street.
          Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
          was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
          buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
          so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

          Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
          the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
          twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.

          The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
          back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
          branded in her cheek.
          Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
          of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
          feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

</b>          White masters would take their pretty
          Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
          excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
          how bad the other slaves had it, always made
          the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
          position, (just in case they'd forgot).

          ran through Greenville at night that catered
          to white masters who were infected with a
          condition that was normally referred to as,
          "Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,

          Calvin sits down.
          Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
          Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

</b>          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my
          friends at my table.
          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
          with a, "Don't be silly."
          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
          join the party.
          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
          is a little more revealing then the others.
          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

          card game. As the game wore on, it came down
          to a two thousand dollar pot between
          Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
          for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
          Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          something in his ear.

</b>          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
          beautiful.
          Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

<b>                         CANDIE
</b>          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          lip. Want some lip?
          Scotty, is a little surprised.

</b>          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
          friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
          Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
          intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
          Calvin's side of the table.
          The game continues.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo
          expert I hired to help me do it.

          One-Eyed Charly?

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          That's what you call it when you buy a slave
          expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
          He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
          legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
          play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
          yes, if you can't.

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          You want me to play a black slaver? There
          ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
          slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
          Django gets that.

          Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
          CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
          Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
          death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

          Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
          Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
          named, ROSCOE tends it.

          And don't think they don't know it either.
          It's about the only thing these dumbass

          well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain

          they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn

          One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
          fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
          been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
          not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to

          The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
          This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
          Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
          The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
          watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.

          The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          apart.

<b>          EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
</b>          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
          picking it.
          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
          Django.

          get a better look at the black riding a horse.
          Django looks back matching their stare.

<b>          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
</b>          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
          among his SHEEP.
          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
          begins tossing them about.
          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
          huge dust cloud behind it.
          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
          ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
          the Big House to greet her brother.

          steps...

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
          South. -
          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
          and for a moment don't know what to think.
          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
          limp.
          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Hello Stephen my boy!

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
          this nigger up on that nag?

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
          shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
          on that nag?

          All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and

          CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
          Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.

           The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
          he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
          Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
          floor below his knees.

          Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
          to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
          on the frightened girl.

          Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
          sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune

          They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
          Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
          Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
          Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
          Domestic Slaves despise Django.
          Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
          though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.

          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          called Eskimo Joe?

          get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one

          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          All three are champions.
          Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.
          All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
          contradict Calvin Candie.
          Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
          that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
          potatoes.

<b>                         LARA LEE
</b>          Hildi!
          Broomhilda snaps back.
          Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          then issues his own appraisal;

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

          the European traveling circus. Hence, I

          Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the

          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.

          Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
          rhubarb pie with him.

          Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
          of ya?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Actually, I was thinking of that poor
          devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
          And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
          all this.
          Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
          bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
          examines he papers.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Dumas...?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.
          If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
          wonder what he would of made of it?

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          You doubt he'd approve?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          at best.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          Soft hearted Frenchy?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Alexander Dumas is black.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          We got it, let's go.

<b>                         (TO CANDIE)
</b>          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
          auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
          actually means is, till I see you again,
          and since I never wish to see you again,
          to you sir, I say, goodbye.
          Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
          When Calvin says to the German's back;

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What?

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          It's a custom here in the South, once a
          business deal is concluded, for the two
          parties to shake hands. It implies good
          faith.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm not from the South.
          He turns to leave.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE
</b>          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
          I must insist.
          This turns Schultz around.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Insist what...? That I shake your hand
          before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
          insist in the opposite direction.
          Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

<b>                         CALVIN CANDIE

          away twelve thousand dollars...?
          I don't think so.

          The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
          it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
          The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
          are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
          whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
          three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

          gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina

          . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
          Django's face.
          Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
          the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
          the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.

          Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
          Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
          alone.
          With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
          hanging Django.

          whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.

          you knew your goose was cooked.
          He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
          Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
          stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
          fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
          tip of that red hot poker.

          didn't know what's what. He still thought his
          ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
          you are, you always know the end is near
          'fore the white folks.
          With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
          The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
          breathing it in his nostrils.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          Damn Nigger, you smell good.
          He walks behind Django with the poker.

<b>                         STEPHEN
</b>          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
          bed in the quest room in the Big House -

          He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
          buttocks.
          Django SCREAMS!
          Stephen LAUGHS.
          Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
          through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
          the floor by the hanging man.

          like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a

          "Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
          Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
          "Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
          mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
          And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?

          Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
          you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
          every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
          And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be

          Like them three y'all came back with. For them

          2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
          trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
          a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
          The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
          stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

          The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
          Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
          and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
          bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
          wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
          The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

          This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
          the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.

          hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That

          a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
          Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
          Candyland on a horse with my white German
          partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
          Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
          Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
          Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
          went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
          Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
          blame me, so here I am.

          They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
          five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
          last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back

           the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
           and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this

          the air, obscuring all visibility...

<b>          THEN ...
</b>          A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
          REVEALING in bright color focus...
          .DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
          Jano.
          He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
          wrapped around his waist.
          He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
          He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
          and climbs aboard him bareback.
          He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
          next to him.
          Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
          beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
          now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
          horses bring the best out of Django.
          From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

<b>          .THEN...
</b>          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
          cage door.
          He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

<b>                         DJANGO
</b>          Throw up that dynamite.
          Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
          his Horse.
          Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
          without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
          The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.

          After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
          opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
          the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

<b>          STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
</b>          That weakens Stonesipher.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
          That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
          That puts the mountain man down on his back.
          He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
          The Trackers are all dead.
          Only the dogs mad barking remains.

          The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk

          This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
          drinks.
          They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
          door.
          Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
          property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
          their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
          The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
          their way.
          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

          The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
          starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
          hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
          As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
          up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
          The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
          mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
          CUE cool MUSIC.
          STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
          ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
          BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
          In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
          ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
          MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
          CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
          The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.

          around his waist.
          Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
          .it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
          ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.

          Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie

          CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
          DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of

          The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
          He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
          He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
          It EXPLODES.
          Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
          blowing the limbs off of many of them.
          The LAWN is SILENT.
          DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
          Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
          satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
          He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
          putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
          wait for him with Fritz and Tony.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Now before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?

          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your

          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Now according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way

          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          I suppose I would.

<b>          COL LANDA

</b>          Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?

          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

<b>          PERRIER
</b>          Probably not.

<b>          COL LANDA
</b>          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.

          of the state. They are simply confused

          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur

          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very
          beautiful women who constitute your
          family?
          The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

          in the ass, sending him on his way.
          Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
          Aldo in the middle.
          As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
          A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
          the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

<b>          NARRATOR(VO)
</b>          Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.
          It's always been his belief, only a
          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,
          pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
          exchange for their worthless lives,
          he made a vow to himself.
          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his
          dignity would be buried with him.
          For in the other world, the gods only
          respect the ones they test first.
          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

</b>          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

</b>          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

<b>          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
</b>          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

</b>          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

</b>
<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          May I sleep here tonight?

</b>          Oui.

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone

</b>          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a

<b>          MADAME MIMIEUX
</b>          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,

          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working

          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film

          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.

          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.

</b>          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase

          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Look Fredrick -

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>
<b>          (SMILING)
</b>          - You remember my name?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          - Merci.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I don't wish to be your friend.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Why not?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I'm more then just a uniform.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Who are you?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I thought I was just a uniform?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Yes.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Really?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          6'O
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Not exactly.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          You were raised by Helga?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          And your mother and father?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          is your cinema still operatiing?

<b>          FREDRICR
</b>          Oui.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What's it called?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          The Kino Haus.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          How has it done durring the war?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          How often do you fill your house?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Wow.

<b>          
</b>
<b>

</b>
<b>          52
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          What's a bird's nest?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          How many Russian's did you kill?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Sixty-eight.

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          I know, comical, huh?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          53.
</b>
<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

<b>          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
</b>          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

<b>          WHEN...
</b>          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          is this your cinema?

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>
<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Tell her to come down.

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          I don't understand, what have I done?

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

<b>          GESTAPO MAJOR
</b>          Who says she's done anything?

<b>          DRIVER
</b>          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

<b>

</b>          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

<b>          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY

          her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

<b>          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
</b>          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

<b>          GOEBBELS

          sweat.
          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

<b>          FREDRICK
</b>          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to

          propaganda, the leader of the entire
          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

<b>          GOEBBELS

          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her

<b>          NARRATOR(VO)
</b>          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

<b>          GOEBBELS
</b>          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

</b>          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the

          like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          our cinema.

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

</b>          I'm not talking about that, your

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

<b>          SHOSANNA
</b>          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

<b>          MARCEL
</b>          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

<b>          SHOSANNA

          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside

          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of

          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the

          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          How's he doing?

<b>          LT. H I COX
</b>          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

<b>          CHURCHELL
</b>          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

<b>          GEM.FENECH
</b>          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is

          new movies in Paris -

          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

<b>          LT.HICOX

          Zoller?

<b>          GEN.FENECH
</b>          We don't have any intelligence, on

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

<b>          GEN.FENECH

          command, including all high ranking

<b>          GEN.FENECH

          scalps of the Nazi dead.

<b>          WICKI
</b>          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

</b>          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

</b>          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

</b>          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,

</b>          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

<b>          FIVE NAZI'S
</b>          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

<b>          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),
</b>
<b>          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
</b>           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

<b>          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
</b>          Yes you arel

<b>          EDGAR WALLACE
</b>          Well, not really.

</b>          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

<b>          BRIDGET/GENGUS
</b>          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

<b>          WINNETOU
</b>          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.

          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark

          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

<b>          MATA HARI
</b>          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

<b>          MATA HARI
</b>          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

<b>          SGT.POLA NEGRI
</b>          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

          understand.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

<b>          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
</b>          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

<b>          NAPOLEON.
</b>          The Germans all laugh.

<b>          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE
</b>
<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

<b>          LT.HICOX
</b>          Why?

<b>          BRIDGET
</b>          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

<b>          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
</b>          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory

<b>          MAJOR HELLSTROM
</b>          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.

          instance, you could write Confucius or

          When you finish writing, put the card

          the person to your left. The person to

          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.

          cinema. We've never been in here before.

<b>          A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:
</b>
<b>          NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
</b>          She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!

<b>          INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>          The stairwell in the building that connects the living
          quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
          through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
          door. She takes out a key and opens it.

<b>          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>          Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
          metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
          out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
          three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
          reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
          lie in wait.

<b>          INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>          The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

<b>          CAMERA FRAME
</b>          directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.

<b>          THEN...
</b>          .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.

<b>          THINK BUBBLE
</b>          Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          I want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          That means now, goddamnit!

          He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
          other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
          Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

          The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
          and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
          their tuxedos, flank her.

          Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
          Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
          then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
          Hirschberg...
          .reaches out and grabs her wrist.
          He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
          because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
          cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

          The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
          boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
          Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
          tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

<b>          BACK TO LOBBY

          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.

<b>          INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>          Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.

          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

          .it fits like a glove.

          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

<b>          HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

<b>          BANG!
</b>
<b>          BANG!
</b>

</b>          She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

<b>          TREMBLING...
</b>          He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

          He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
          face right in the middle of the hood.

          truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
          bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.

          junk pile, right behind the screen.
           Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and

          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic

<b>          EXT -- WOODS - MORNING
</b>          It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
          truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
          Herrman in the front comes to stop.
          LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
          Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

<b>          HERRMAN
</b>          These are the American lines, sir.
          In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
          of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
          both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
          Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.          

<b>          
</b>
<b>          143
</b>          Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
          Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
          the two prisoners.
          He does.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Herrman, hand them your weapon.
          He does.
          Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

<b>          DAGGER.
</b>
<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          I am officially surrendering myself
          over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
          prisoners.

<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
          cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
          back.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Is that really necessary?
          As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

<b>          SAYS;
</b>
<b>          LT.ALDO
</b>          I'm a slave to appearances.
          Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
          The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

<b>          COL.LANDA
</b>          Are you mad? What have you done? I made
          a deal with your General for that mans

<b>          LT. ALDO
</b>          Yeah, they made that deal, but they
          don't give a fuck about him, they
          need you.

          heard that deal you made with the Brass.
          End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
          How bout you Uitivich, you make that
          deal?

<b>          UITIVICH

</b>          I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
          And that pretty little nest ya
          feathered for yourself. Well, if
          your willing to barbecue the whole
          high command, I suppose that's worth
          certain considerations. Now I don't
          care about you gettin pensions,

          For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

</b>          I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
          that goddamn uniform for the rest of
          your pecker suckin life. But I'm
          aware that's ain't practical. I mean
          at some point ya gotta hafta take it
          off.
          He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans

   EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY
   
   VIDEO
   
   A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all
   holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.
   
   The cheap VIDEO TITLES to:
   
   "CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"
   
   Play over this image.
   
   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (to camera)
             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
             its makers as being tough as the
             toughest customer.
   
   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
   VOICE begins talking over the video.
   
                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)
             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
             spray gun outta South Miami.
   
   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
   
                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
             for two hundred and sell 'em for
             eight.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
   ROBBIE.
   
   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
   
   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
   
   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
   body language and his thought process.
   
   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
   correction facility, in the real world his timing is
   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
   but attempt to sing anyway.
   
   The third person watching the video is the person who
   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
   from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
   and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
   
   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
   paying no attention to the video.
   
                       ORDELL
             This TEC-9? They advertise it as
             being the most popular gun in
             American crime. Can you believe that
             shit? It actually says that on the
             little booklet that comes with it.
             "Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
             like they're proud of that shit.
   
   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.
   
   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Check out this body-builder chick...
             Now see what she got. That's a Styer
             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
             Listen.
   
   Ordell punches up the volume.
   
   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.
   
   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
             Austria. My customers don't know shit
             about it, so there ain't no demand.
                   (to Melanie)
             Baby, I could use some more ice.
   
   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
   from him and moves to the kitchen.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             But put that bad boy in a flick,
             every motherfucker out there want
             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
             they don't want one, they want two,
             cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
             What they don't know, and that movie
             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
             and steer a customer towards a 9-
             millimeter. Damn near the same
             weapon, don't have half the jammin'
             problems. But some niggas out there,
             you can't tell them anything. They
             want a .45. The killer had a .45,
             they want a .45.
   
   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
   sits where she was.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Thanks, Baby.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's your partner?
   
   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
   "Movieline Inside" magazine.
   
                       ORDELL
             Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
             Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
             him, gets it to my customers. On all
             my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
             have a pot to piss in or a window to
             throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
             motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
             got himself a yacht, with all kinds
             of high tech navigational shit on it.
                   (back to video)
             AK-47, the very best there is.
   
   GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
   camera and describes the AK-47.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             When you absolutely, positively,
             gotta kill every motherfucker in the
             room, accept no substitute. That
             there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
             fifty and double my money.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL(CONT'D)
             Get that for me, will ya baby?
   
                       MELANIE
             You know it's for you.
   
   Ordell just stares at her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, you better not make me go over
             there and put my feet to ya.
   
   Louis keeps staring at he screen.
   
   Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
   the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
   says:
   
                       MELANIE
             Hello.
   
   Puts the phone down and says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             It's for you.
   
   Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
   chair, reclining back all the way.
   
   Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
   phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Yeah.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Junebug, what's up
   
   Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
   watching the video.
   
   Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
   her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;
   
                       MELANIE
                   (referring to the tape)
             It's boring, isn't it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I can sit through it once.
   
                       MELANIE
             He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
   
                       MELANIE
             He's just repeating shit he
             overheard. He ain't any more a gun
             expert than I am.
   
   Holding up her pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a hit?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.
   
   Louis takes a hit off the pipe.
   
                       MELANIE
             When did you get out of jail?
   
                       LOUIS
             Four days ago.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where at?
   
                       LOUIS
             Susanville.
   
                       MELANIE
             How long?
   
                       LOUIS
             Two months shy of four years.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MELANIE
             What for?
   
                       LOUIS
             Bank robbery.
   
                       MELANIE
             Really, I'm impressed.
   
   Louis takes a drink of whiskey.
   
                       MELANIE
             Four years that's a long fuckin time.
   
   Louis nods his head in agreement.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
   Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             See, what did I tell you? Man in New
             York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
             Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
             it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
             York Undercover" uses. Because of
             that nigga, I can sell it to this
             nigga for twelve-fifty.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your cost?
   
                       ORDELL
             As low as two.
   
                       LOUIS
             Are you serious?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what I been tellin' you. Start
             adding these motherfuckin' figures
             up, and you tell me this ain't a
             business to be in.
   
   The phone rings again.
   
   Ordell looks at Melanie.
   
   Melanie looks at Ordell.
   
   They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
   and gets the phone.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I got me five M-60 machine guns.
             These came straight from the Gulf
             War. I sold me three of them so far,
             twenty grand a piece.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's good money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
             make me a million dollars out of
             this. I already got me a half-a-
             million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
             this last delivery, I'm gonna make me
             another half-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Then what?
   
                       ORDELL
             I get out. Spend the rest of my life
             spending.
   
   Melanie sits back down in he chair.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Who is it?
   
                       MELANIE
             It's Beaumont.
   
   
   KITCHEN
   
   Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (into phone)
             Beaumont¢Ordell. What's the problem?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' in jail?
                   (pause)
             What the fuck you doin' that for?
                   (pause)
             Ain't you got better sense than to be
             drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
             pistol?
   
   He listens to Beaumont on the other line - it's obvious
   Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his
   tone.
   
                   ORDELL (CONT'D)
             - Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
             Number one, you need to chill out,
             nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit
             ain't as bad as you think it is.
                   (pause)
             Course you're scared. That's what
             these motherfuckers get paid for
             scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
             their job. And my job is to get you
             the fuck home so let me tell you what
             is gonna happen... May I speak?...
             Thank you... You gonna spend the
             night in jail; it's too late to get
             you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna
             take you into court. I'm gonna be
             there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm
             gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut
             you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll
             be back home, I promise.
                   (pause)
             So just calm your ass down, and I'll
             see you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
             You owe me a helluva lot more than
             one, nigga.
                   (laughs)
             See you.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
   California. The name of the business is spelled out on
   the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
   cherry.
   
   Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.
   
   Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
   window. We can read the name on the glass backwards.
   Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
   building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.
   
   An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
   can be heard.
   
   Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
   back."
   
                       MALE VOICE (O.S.)
             ... the judge doesn't give a fuck
             about that. He's ready to habitualize
             you. Is that what you want - you
             wanna look at ten years?
   
   The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
   regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind
   his desk talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees
   Ordell approach him.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
             get you out, I promise. But it means
             I gotta pick you up tonight.
   
   Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
   motions for Ordell to take a seat.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
             it. You're spending the night in
             jail, but I already told you I'll get
             you out tomorrow. Now where are you?
                   (pause)
             You're at your mother's house, aren't
             you?
   
   Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).
   
   He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
   around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
   grinning.
   
   Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
   small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
   non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
   rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (on phone)
             Okay. Just stay put till I come for
             you.
                   (pause)
             Reggie, do yourself a really big
             favor and be there when I get there.
   
   He hangs up the phone.
   
   Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and
   smoking.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             How can I help you?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (indicating the Viceroy)
             Where would you like me to put my
             ash?
   
   Max looks at him for a moment.
   
                       MAX
             Use that coffee cup on the desk.
   
   Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
   bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.
   
                       ORDELL
             And I need me a bond for ten
             thousand.
   
   Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Oh, that's just my white friend,
             Louis. He's got nothing to do with my
             business. We just hangin together.
             We're on our way to a cocktail
             lounge.
   
   From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's
   direction.
   
   Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (returning to the photo)
             Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
             gotcha arm around?
   
   Max looks at him a moment and says;
   
                       MAX
             That's Winston. He works here.
   
                       ORDELL
             He's a big one. You two tight?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             It was our idea to take the picture,
             wasn't it?
   
   Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;
   
                       MAX
             So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
             bond. What've you got for collateral?
   
                       ORDELL
             Gonna have to put up cash.
   
                       MAX
             You have it with you?
   
   Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty
   chair next to him.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's in my bag.
   
                       MAX
             You have cash. What do you need me
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             C'mon, you know how they do. Black
             man comes in with ten thousand, they
             wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
             gonna wanna know where I got it.
             Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
             of it - start talkin' that court cost
             shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go
             through you.
   
                       MAX
             Cost you a thousand for the bond.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know that.
   
   Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other
   room drinking coffee.
   
                       MAX
             Who's it for? A relative?
   
                       ORDELL
             Fella named Beaumont. They have him
             up at county. It started out drunk
             driving, but they wrote it up
             "possession of a concealed weapon."
             Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
   
                       MAX
             Ten thousand sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             They ran his name and got a hit. He's
             been in before. Besides, Beaumont's
             from Kentucky, and I think they're
             prejudiced against black men from the
             South out here.
   
                       MAX
             He takes off and I gotta go to
             Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
             the expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think you could do that?
   
   Max taking papers out of the drawer...
   
                       MAX
             I've done it.
   
   ... picking up the pen...
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What's his full name?
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont. That's the only name I
             know.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious
   question.
   
   Max picks up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (on phone)
             Records office.
   
   Max on hold, looks at Ordell.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (back on the line)
             Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
             Bail Bonds. Who's this?
                   (pause)
             Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to
             look up the booking card and rough
             arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
                   (pause)
             That's all I have. I believe it's a
             surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.
   
   Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm going to wait in the car.
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
                   (to Max)
             We almost done, ain't we?
   
                       MAX
             Getting there.
   
                       ORDELL
             You go wait in the car. Wait a
             minute.
   
   Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
   keys on it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
   
                       LOUIS
             Which one is for the car?
   
   Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
   comes back on the line.
   
   Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (holding a key)
             This one's for the ignition...
                   (holding a little black
                   box)
             ... but you gotta hit this thing to
             shut the alarm off and unlock the
             door.
   
                       LOUIS
             What do I do?
   
                       ORDELL
             You ain't got to do nothing. Just
             point at it and push the button.
             You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
             means the alarm's off and the doors
             are open.
   
                       LOUIS
             Okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now play the volume as loud as you
             want but don't touch my levels. I got
             them set just the way I want 'em.
   
   Louis nods and goes out.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
   black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
   car goes BLEEP.
   
   He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
   inside.
   
   
   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   Max hangs up the phone.
   
                       MAX
                   (to Ordell)
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             Livingston, huh?
   
                       MAX
             On his prior, he served nine months,
             and he's working on four years'
             probation.
   
                       ORDELL
             You don't say.
   
                       MAX
             Do you know what he's on probation
             for?
   
                       ORDELL
             Haven't a clue.
   
                       MAX
             Possession of unregistered machine
             guns.
   
                       ORDELL
             Will they consider this a violation
             of his probation?
   
                       MAX
             They do consider this a violation of
             his probation. Your boy's looking at
             ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
             don't got a doin' time disposition.
   
                       MAX
             I need your name and address.
   
                       ORDELL
             Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I-
             E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton
             90222.
   
                       MAX
             House or apartment?
   
                       ORDELL
             House.
   
                       MAX
             Now I need you to count your money.
   
   Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
   putting it on the desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hope you don't mind me askin' where
             you keepin' my money till I get it
             back. In your drawer?
   
   Max begins counting it.
   
                       MAX
             Across the street a Great Western. It
             goes in a trust account. You'll need
             to fill out an Application for
             Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
             Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
             Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
             skips and I go after him, you pay the
             expenses.
   
                       ORDELL
             Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
                   (he takes a pen out of
                   his pocket)
             Where do I sign?
   
   Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
   of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell
   reads the first agreement then says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (reading the form)
             Hey, Max.
   
                       MAX
                   (still counting money)
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (still reading form)
             I was wondering. What if before the
             court date gets here, Beaumont gets
             hit by a bus or something and dies.
                   (he puts the form down
                   and looks at Max)
             I get my money back, don't I?
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A BLACK FINGER
   
   Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT
   LIVINGSTON".
   
   
   INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and
   smoking a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes
   loudly. We can hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on
   TV OFFSCREEN.
   
                       BEAUMONT
                   (into the speaker)
             Who is it?
   
   
   EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
   Hollywood apartment.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
   speaker.
   
                       ORDELL
             It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
             up.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
   button.
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
   BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.
   
   Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
   fingers. He sees Ordell approach.
   
   Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
   big smile across his face.
   
                       ORDELL
             Look at you and your free ass. Come
             over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
   
   Ordell and Beaumont embrace.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
             man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
             you... thank you... thank you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who was there for your ass?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You were there for me.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             You.

   Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
   hard.
   
                       ORDELL
             You goddam right!
   
   Beaumont laughs.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see,ïit works like this. You get
             your ass in trouble, I get your ass
             out. That's my job. And I don't mind
             tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
             Ordell. They talkin' like they
             serious 'bout me doin' that machine
             gun time.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
             fright in your ass.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             If that's what they want to do,
             they're doin' it.
   
                       ORDELL
             How old is that machine gun shit?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Three years.
   
                       ORDELL
             Three years. That crime's old, man.
             They ain't got room in prison for all
             the motherfuckers out there killin'
             people. How they gonna find room for
             you?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That's not what they're tellin' me.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why they call it "fuckin' with
             ya." Now you wanna hear how we
             retaliate?
   
   Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
             Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
             me tell you a little bit about my
             lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
             this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
             own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
             he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
             like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
             fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
             lives to fuck with the police. So as
             a favor, I had him look at your case.
             Stacin told me you aint got shit to
             worry about. They just fuckin' wit
             ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
             their ass, make 'em -
             (he bumps fist with Beaumont)
             ... Stop fuckin' wit ya!
   
   Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
             know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
             kinda hopin you could come with me.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What'd ya mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
             does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
             hits a nigga up for a favor in
             return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
             that kinda nigga.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             I need a favor.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             That requires me goin out tonight?
   
                       ORDELL
             A bit.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
             goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
             man. I'm home, I'm high -
   

                       ORDELL
             Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
             spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
             your ass home.
                   (changes tone)
             Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
             and you can help me.
   
   This has the desired effect.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
   
   Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
   Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             What's the problem?
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
             situation. Remember I sold those
             three M-60 machine guns outta the
             five I got?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
             This group of Koreans in Koreatown
             have started a Neighborhood Watch
             kinda thing. And they want a few
             weapons so the neighborhood niggas
             know they mean business. So I'm gonna
             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
             Only problem, I aint never dealt with
             these Koreans before. Now I aint
             worried. Asians are by and large real
             dependable. They don't want no
             trouble. You might argue about price,
             but you aint gotta worry about them
             shootin' you in the back. But I got
             me kind of a rule. Never do business
             with nobody you ain't never done
             business with before without backup.
             That's why I need you, backup.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
             nowhere -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Let me finish. Can I finish?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Go ahead.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   The trunk of a car is opened.
   
   Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
   action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
   of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
   a playing piece.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now you're gonn be in the trunk
             holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
             going to tell them I'm opening up my
             trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
             the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
             boy.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
             anybody.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck I tell you. You don't
             hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
             gun. They'll get the idea.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
             be in there - ten minutes.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
             no minutes. Why don't I just ride
             with you?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't ride with me. The surprise
             effect is ninety percent of it.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
             gittin' in that trunk.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can't believe you do me this way.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             I ain't doin' you no way. I just
             ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
             problem with small places.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, my ass has got a problem
             spending ten thousand dollars of my
             own goddam money to get ungrateful,
             peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
             do it -
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Look, man, I know I owe you -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Well, if you owe me, git your ass
             in the trunk.
   
                       BEAUMONT
             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
             be locked in the trunk of no car.
   
                       ORDELL
             You think I wanted to spend ten
             thousand dollars on your ass?
   
   Beaumont starts to speak -
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Answer the question, nigga. Do you
             think I wanted to spend the thousand
             dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Course you didn't.
   
                       ORDELL
             But the only way to help you was to
             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
             how 'bout this? After we're through
             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
             My treat.
   
   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
             smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
             side of red beans and rice.
             Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
   
   Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;
   
                       BEAUMONT
             Now exactly how long I gotta be in
             this motherfucker.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   TRUNK
   
   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
   is SLAMMED closed.
   
   
   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
   inside the dash.
   
   The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
   
   Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.
   
   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
   mouthing the words.
   
   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
   
   ... then stops.
   
   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
   goes black.
   
   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
   
   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
   the glovebox.
   
   The cab goes black.
   
   
   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
   
   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
   nowhere.
   
   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
   trunk and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't worry. It's just me.
   
   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
   shotgun.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I was wondering. Did any federal
             people come visit you in jail and I
             should be watching my ass?
   
   Beaumont doesn't say anything.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You wouldn't tell me if they did and
             I wouldn't blame you.
   
   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
   
   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
   
   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
   
   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B
   song come back on, but VERY LOW.
   
   Ordell drives the Olds away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
   from one channel to another with a remote control,
   drinking cocktails from a can.
   
   The phone rings. He answers it.
   
                       LOUIS
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
   Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
   phone next to his ear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
   
                       ORDELL
             Whatcha watchin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
             and forth. They had some black girl
             from some black show on Jay Leno. I
             watched that for a bit, but I kept
             flippin channels cause I didn't know
             who she was.
   
                       ORDELL
             Guess where I am?
   
                       LOUIS
             I dunno.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know you don't know. I said guess.
   
                       LOUIS
             The moon - I dunno
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
             cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
             outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're outside?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       LOUIS
             C'mon in.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
             comfortable. I ain't about to walk
             into that roach motel and get
             uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
             here.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm in my underwear.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then put your goddam drawers on, and
             get your ass out here. I got
             somethin' to show you.
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
   his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
   in front of the motel.
   
   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
   in his seat looking up at Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what your problem is, Louis?
   
   Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
   pockets.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You think you're a good guy. When you
             go into a deal you don't go in
             prepared to take that motherfucker
             all the way. You go in looking for a
             way out. And it ain't cause you're
             scared neither. It's cause you think
             you're a good guy, and you think
             there's certain things a good guy
             won't do. That's where we're
             different, me and you. Cause me, once
             I decide I want something, aint a
             goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
             me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
             get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
             Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
             removed. Understand what I'm saying?
   
   
   CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
   
   Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
   his head blown off.
   
   Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
   back to Beaumont.
   
   Ordell closes the trunk.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was that?
   
                       ORDELL
             That was Beaumont.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who was Beaumont?
   
                       ORDELL
             An employee I had to let go.
   
                       LOUIS
             What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL
             He put himself in a situation where
             he was gonna have to do ten years in
             the penetentiary, that's what he did.
                   (taking out a Viceroy and
                   lighting it up)
             And if you know Beaumont, you know
             there aint no way in hell he can do
             no ten years. And if you know that,
             you know Beaumont's gonna go any
             goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
             from doin' those ten years including
             telling the Federal government
             everything they want to know about my
             ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
             case of him or me. And you best
             believe it aint gonna be me. You know
             what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
             this with me, you gotta be prepared
             to go all the way. I got me so far
             over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
             in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
             Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
             more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
             a million. You think I'm gonna let
             this little cheese eatin' nigga here
             fuck that up? Shit, you better think
             again. 'Fore I let this deal get
             fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
             the head, and ten niggas look just
             like em.
                   (pause)
             Understand what I'm sayin'?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we on the same page then?
   
                       LOUIS
             I follow.
   
   Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
   smile).
   
   Louis grins.
   
   They both bump fists.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK:
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "JACKIE BROWN"
   
   The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be
   heard underneath this...
   
   
   INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"
   
   We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
   at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
   opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
   she walks down the row of cars.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Miss Brown.
   
   She turns towards the voice/camera.
   
   Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
   holding open his I.D. case.
   
                       DARGUS
             Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
             L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
             that bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             The usual things. I'm a flight
             attendant with Cabo Air.
   
   Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.
   
                       NICOLET
             Can I be of some assistance?
   
   As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
   purse, she says to Ray;
   
                       JACKIE
             I doubt it.
                   (to Dargus)
             Who's your friend?
   
                       DARGUS
             This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
             with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
             Would you mind if we looked in that
             bag?
   
   Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.
   
                       JACKIE
             Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
   
                       DARGUS
             You have the right to say "no." And I
             have the right to make you wait here
             with Ray while I go get a warrant.
             And if I don't want to go through all
             that trouble, I could just take you
             in on suspicion.
   
                       JACKIE
             Suspicion of what?
   
                       NICOLET
             All he wants to do is peek in your
             bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
             anything.
   
   Jackie shrugs and says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead.
   
   Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on
   his haunches, and starts feeling through her things.
   
   
   CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG
   
   A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope,
   a fat one, nine-by-twelve.
   
   Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...
   
   
   ENVELOPE
   
   Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
   bills secured with rubberbands.
   
   Nicolet whistles.
   
   Dargus looks up at her.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
             thousand dollars here. What would you
             say Ray?
   
                       NICOLET
             That looks like fifty thousand
             dollars from here.
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Not saying anything at the moment.
   
                       DARGUS
             This is your money?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I were to tell you "no it
             isn't..."
   
   Dargus smiles.
   
                       DARGUS
             You should know if you bring in
             anything over ten thousand you have
             to declare it. You forgot or what?
             You could get a two hundred and fifty
             thousand dollar fine, plus two years
             in prison. Now you want to talk to us
             about it, or you want to talk to
             Customs?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not saying another word.
   
                       NICOLET
             Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
             if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
             of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
             Something about that job makes them
             kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
             you want to talk with a bunch of
             suspicious, disagreeable people like
             them, or a couple good-hearted guys
             like Mark and myself.
   
   Nicolet smiles.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Doesn't smile back.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives.
   Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP
   until noted.
   
   
   INT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Hey, this is my office. There's no
             smoking.
   
                       JACKIE
             Arrest me.
   
   Nicolet laughs O.S.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             We could, smart ass... or we could
             work out what's known as a
             Substantial Assistance Agreement.
             That is if you're willing to
             cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
             money and who you're giving it to.
   
   Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             You got a good lawyer?
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Can she afford a good one is the
             question. Otherwise she'll be in
             Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
             the Public Defender gets around to
             her.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.)
             Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
             Livingston?
   
   Not a word.
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
             'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
             did know you, Beaumont was found in
             the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
             twice. Once in the head and once in
             the chest.
   
   Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."
   
                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
             yesterday. You see, like you,
             Beaumont found himself in some hot
             water. He was looking at ten years he
             was pretty sure he didn't want to do
             and was understandably concerned. Now
             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.
   
   Not a word.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             If you don't want to talk to us, I
             guess we'll just have to hand you
             over to Customs.
   
   Jackie puts out her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay, let's go.
   
   She stares down the cops.
   
   
   DARGUS AND NICOLET
   
   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
   first time in the scene.
   
                       DARGUS
             You know, Miss Brown, there's
             basically three types of people that
             we come along in the performance of
             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
             Victims, witnesses, innocent
             bystanders... You ain't any of these.
             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
             sonabitches have dedicated their
             lives to a life outside the law. That
             ain't you either. Where you belong is
             the third category. The category we
             refer to as LOSERS.
   
   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
   says without expression;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not a loser.
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
             flying for TWA and got busted for
             carrying drugs. You were carrying
             them for a pilot husband of yours. He
             did time and you got off. But that
             ended your career with the big
             airlines. Cut to thirteen years
             later. You're forty-four years of
             age. You're flying for the shittiest
             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
             Mexican airline that there is. Where
             you make a whopping twelve-thousand
             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
             lot to show for a twenty year career.
             And to top it off, you're going to
             jail. Now true, the judge, even with
             your prior, will probably only give
             you a year or two. But this doesn't
             seem like the time of life you got
             years to throw away.
                   (pause)
             Now, we don't like trying losers like
             they're criminals. But in the absence
             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
             wasn't this money given to you by an
             American living in Mexico by the name
             of Cedric Walker?
   
   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.
   
   Nicolet joins back in.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
             the hell it was he worked for out
             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
             the same person you were supposed to
             deliver this money to?
   
   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.
   
   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
   it.
   
                       DARGUS
             I'd like your permission to open this
             again. So we'll know exactly how much
             money we're talkin' about here.
   
   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
   it on the desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Help yourself.
   
                       DARGUS
             While you're at it, let me see what
             else is in there. You mind?
   
   She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.
   
                       JACKIE
             My pocketbook.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's in it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Beauty products.
   
   Nicolet takes the manila envelope.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'll count the money.
   
   Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
   packets in it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's this?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's my diet shit.
   
   Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.
   
                       DARGUS
             Let's see what else is in there.
   
   Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
   His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, Miss Brown?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah?
   
   Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
   half-inch or so of white powder inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             And what would this be, Sweet and
             Low?
   
                       JACKIE
             What the fuck is that shit?
   
                       NICOLET
             I know what it looks like.
   
                       JACKIE
             You planted that shit on me.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, that shit ain't mine.
   
                       NICOLET
                   (to Dargus)
             It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
             how 'bout Posession with the Intent
             to Distribute?
   
                       DARGUS
             Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
             all the cash, I think I could go with
             Conspiracy to Traffic.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
             about that fuckin' shit.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
             have a seat and tell us who might
             know something about this fuckin'
             shit.
   
   Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as
   the balance of power rolls over on her.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
   Torrance Court House.
   
   
   INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to
   another BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.
   
   The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF
   unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then
   explains in a you-better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner,
   how they're going to leave the bus.
   
   
   EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY
   
   MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
   and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.
   
   The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
   court house.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY
   
   Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
   attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.
   
                       DARGUS
             If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
             turn possession with intent into
             plain ol' Possession, and she can
             bond outta here for one thousand
             bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
             go for the Intent and request a
             twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.
   
   
   INT. COURTROOM - DAY
   
   Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county
   blues; Public Defender in her nice suit.
   
                       JACKIE
             You tell those guys they'll have to
             do one helluva lot better than that
             before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             Well, that's the State's offer. If
             you plead to possession and tell
             L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your
             bond will be set at one-thousand
             dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
             request one at twenty- five thousand
             based on your prior record and risk
             of flight. If you don't post it or
             don't know anyone who can, you'll
             spend six to eight weeks in County
             before your arraignment comes up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who's side are you on?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             I beg your pardon?
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I plead guilty?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             And cooperate? You might get
             probation.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I don't cooperate?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             With the prior? You could get
             anywhere from a year to five
             depending on the judge. You want to
             think about it? You got two minutes
             before we're up.
   
   
   COURT IN SESSION
   
   It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a
   bunch of other females wearing county blues in the
   defendant's area (where the jury sits during a jury
   trial)
   
   Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.
   
   The JUDGE reads the next case.
   
                       JUDGE
             Brown. Case number 700324.
   
   Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.
   
   The P.D. rises.
   
   Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.
   
                       JUDGE
             The charge is possession of Narcotics
             with the Intent to Distribute. How
             does your client plead?
   
                       PUBLIC DEFENDER
             She wishes to stand mute, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             Very well...
                   (to Dargus)
             ... Detective Dargus - You're the
             arresting officer in his case,
             correct?
   
                       DARGUS
             That's correct, your honor.
   
                       JUDGE
             You have a recommendation for bail?
   
                       DARGUS
             Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
             defendant's prior conviction and the
             extreme possibility of flight due to
             her occupation, the State requests a
             bond of no less than twenty-five
             thousand.
   
   The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...
   
                       JUDGE
             I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
             the date of August 14th for the
             arraignment.
   
                       JACKIE
             When is that, your honor?
   
                       JUDGE
             That's six weeks from now, Miss
             Brown. We'll continue this matter
             then. Owens, case 72242.
   
   Jackie sits down.
   
   Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
   together.
   
   Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking
   pisses her off.
   
   
   DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE
   
   We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a
   perspective from the back of the courtroom.
   
   We see Jackie in the defendant's area.
   
   We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
   out of the courtroom.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
   expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out
   of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   TITLE CARD
   
   "MAX CHERRY"
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY
   
   The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
   behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges,
   zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.
   
   He looks up and stops dead.
   
   Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
   Max's desk.
   
                       ORDELL
             Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you
             wash your hands.
   
   Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his
   desk.
   
                       MAX
             Comfortable?
   
                       ORDELL
             The door was opened, so I just came
             right in.
   
                       MAX
             I can see that. Why?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got some more business for ya.
   
                       MAX
             Oh, yeah? What did he do?
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             She is an airline stewardess. Got
             caught coming back from Mexico with
             some blow. They set her bond this
             afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
             I was thinkin', you could use the ten
             thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
             move it over on to the stewardess.
   
                       MAX
             The bond for possession is only a
             thousand.
   
                       ORDELL
             They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
             it Possession with Intent. A black
             woman in her forties gets busted with
             less than two ounces on her, they
             call that shit Intent. Same shit
             happened to a movie star. It's
             Possession.
   
                       MAX
             It still sounds high.
   
                       ORDELL
             She had, I believe it was... fifty
             grand on her, too. There was a cop at
             the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
             wanted her bond set at twenty-five
             thousand, saying there was a risk of
             flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
             all.
   
                       MAX
             Before we start talking about
             stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
             the way first.
   
   Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not
   quite.
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody already did.
   
                       MAX
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't hear?
   
                       MAX
             Hear what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Somebody with a grudge blew
             Beaumont's brains out - hey, that
             rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.
   
                       MAX
             Did the police contact you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Very first motherfuckin' thing they
             did. They see I put up a big money
             bond on my boy, they start thinking
             with that where-there's-smoke-there's
             fire logic. They roust my ass outta
             bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
             Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
             to death. She thought they were gonna
             take my ass away for sure.
   
                       MAX
             The stewardess. Do you know her last
             name?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiles)
             Brown, Jackie Brown.
   
                       MAX
             What does she do for you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who says she does anything for me?
             She's my friend. When my friends get
             into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
   
                       MAX
             Beaumont worked for you.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's what the police thought. I
             told them I'm unemployed, how could I
             have anybody work for me? Now I bail
             out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
             police on me again, huh? Wanting to
             know was she doing things for me, was
             she bringing me that money!
   
                       MAX
             Was she?
   
                       ORDELL
             Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
             client relationship? The lawyer can't
             tell nothing he hears?
   
                       MAX
             You're not my client until you get
             busted and I bond you out.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there's no - what do you call it -
             confidentiality between us? Why would
             I tell you anything?
   
                       MAX
             Cause you want me to know what a
             slick guy you are. You got
             stewardesses bringing you fifty
             grand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
             grand?
   
                       MAX
             You want me to speculate on what you
             do. I'd say you're in the drug
             business, except the money's moving
             in the wrong direction. Whatever
             you're into, you seem to be getting
             away with it, so more power to you.
             Okay you want another bond, and you
             want to move over the ten thousand
             you put down on Beaumont to the
             stewardess. That means paperwork. I
             have to get a death certificate,
             present it to the court, fill out a
             receipt for return of bond
             collateral, then type up another
             application. An indemnity agreement -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Jackie aint got time for all that
             shit -
   
                       MAX
             - I'm telling you what I have to do.
             What you have to do, in case you
             forgot, is come up with premium of a
             thousand bucks.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got it. I just don't got it on me.
   
                       MAX
             Well, come back when you do, and I'll
             bond out the stewardess.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you know I'm good for it.
             Thousand bucks ain't shit.
   
                       MAX
             If I don't see it in front of me,
             you're right. It ain't shit.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, you need to look at this with a
             little compassion. Jackie ain't no
             criminal. She ain't used to this
             kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
             don't give a fuck - but for the
             average citizen, coupla nights in
             County fuck with your mind.
   
                       MAX
             Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
             don't have a tab.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just listen for a second. We got a
             forty-year-old, gainfully employed
             black woman, falsely accused -
   
                       MAX
             Falsely accused? She didn't come back
             from Mexico with cocaine on her?
   
                       ORDELL
             Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
             that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
             - it was just her shit to get high
             with.
   
                       MAX
             Is white guilt supposed to make me
             forget I'm running a business?
   
   Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, man. I got your money. But
             don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
             favor.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is
   driving to the County Jail with a client, a young
   Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA.
   
                       MAX
             Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
             officer. Karen's a good kid, but
             she's mad at you, because you lied to
             her. This business about your
             grandmother's funeral
   
                       ANITA
             I went. I did. I took my mother and
             little brother.
   
                       MAX
             But you didn't ask permission. You
             broke a trust. If you had asked,
             Karen probably would have let you.
             I'm sure she would.
   
                       ANITA
             I know. That's why I went.
   
                       MAX
             But then you told her you were home.
   
                       ANITA
             Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
             could go.
   
   Max gives up.
   
                       MAX
             I don't know. Maybe it's a language
             problem.
                   (getting stern)
             Anita, you ever cause this much
             heartache over something that could
             easily be avoided, I'll never write
             you again. You understand?
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             I mean it. I don't care how many
             times your mother calls or how much
             she cries.
   
   Like an exasperated teenager.
   
                       ANITA
             I understand.
   
                       MAX
             Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
   
                       ANITA
             Yes, Max, I understand.
   
   
   INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
   
   POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE
   
   Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed
   behind her back.
   
                       MAX
             Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
             of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
             Jackie.
   
   We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
   undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take
   her away.
   
                       ANITA
             So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
   
                       MAX
             I'll call her.
   
                       ANITA
             Won't forget?
   
                       MAX
             I won't forget.
   
   She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her
   away.
   
                       ANITA
             Thanks, Max. See you later.
   
   Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
   Deighton paperback and begins to read.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   MAX
   
   Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
   voice.
   
                       SHERIFF (O.S.)
             Max! Here she comes.
   
   Max puts his book down and see -
   
   Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
   She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
   envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
   Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
   with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
   Jackie Brown's a knockout.
   
   As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail
   slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes.
   
   He approaches, handing her his card.
   
                       MAX
             Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
             your bail bondsman.
   
   She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I can give you a lift home if you'd
             like?
   
                       JACKIE
             Okay.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT
   
   Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you really a bail bondsman?
   
                       MAX
             Who do you think I am?
   
   She doesn't answer.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             I gave you my card there.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I see your I.D.?
   
                       MAX
             You're serious?
   
   She waits.
   
   Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her,
   then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her
   to see.
   
   
   MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF
   CALIFORNIA
   
                       JACKIE
             Who put up my bond? Ordell?
   
                       MAX
             In cash.
   
   She looks straight ahead.
   
   Max shifts into drive.
   
   Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY
   comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window
   Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy
   his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then
   puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He
   drives on.
   
   
   MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)
   
                       JACKIE
             Can we stop for cigarettes?
   
                       MAX
             Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so.
   
                       MAX
             It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
   
                       JACKIE
             Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
             eleven?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might want a drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'd love one, but not there.
   
                       MAX
             We could stop at the Hilton by the
             airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Is it dark?
   
                       MAX
             It's kind of a sports bar
   
                       JACKIE
             That doesn't sound dark.
   
                       MAX
             Why does it need to be dark?
   
                       JACKIE
             'Cause I look like I just got outta
             jail, that's why. You droppin' me off
             at home, right? There's a place by
             me.
   
                       MAX
             Great.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
   inn.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT
   
   CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.
   
   Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
   the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
   join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
   return.
   
   The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
   dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
   Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
   lives (about ten minutes from LAX)
   
   The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
   and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
   years before it became a black bar.
   
   A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R&B.
   
   Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
   a bar candle in a red glass thing.
   
   Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
   white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
   Max.
   
                       MAX
             No thanks, I quit three years ago.
   
   As she lights her cigarette.
   
                       JACKIE
             You gain weight?
   
                       MAX
             Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
             on.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why I don't quit. If I can't
             fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
             of a time gettin' my brand.
   
                       MAX
             What's your brand?
   
                       JACKIE
             Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
             They're hard to find here. I was
             locked up with the last two getting
             legal advice from a woman who was in
             for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
             with a baseball bat.
   
                       MAX
             Was she helpful?
   
                       JACKIE
             She was more helpful than the fuckin'
             Public Defender.
                   (she takes a sip of wine)
             I don't know - I guess what I need is
             a lawyer, find out what my options
             are.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I figured out the other day
             I've written something like' fifteen
             thousand bonds since I've been in the
             business. I'd say about eighty
             percent of them were at least drug
             related. If you want, I can help you
             look at your options.
   
   Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not tired of it?
   
                       MAX
                   (smiles)
             I am, as a matter of fact.
   
   A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What have they told you?
   
                       JACKIE
             So far I've been told I can cooperate
             and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
             stand mute and get as much as five
             years. Does that sound right?
   
                       MAX
             I'd say if you're tried and found
             guilty you won't get more than a year
             and a day. That's State time. Prison.
   
                       JACKIE
                   (under her breath)
             Shit.
   
                       MAX
             But they won't want to take you to
             trial. They'll offer you simple
             Possession, a few months of County
             time, and a year or two probation.
                   (pointing to her drink)
             How 'bout another?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
   ROWEN for two more.
   
                       MAX
             You know who put the dope in your
             bag?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but that's not what this was
             about. They were fuckin waitin' for
             my ass. They knew I had that money,
             they even knew the amount. The one
             who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
             Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
             "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
             here. What would you say?" But all
             they could do was threaten me and
             hand me over to Customs, and I could
             tell they didn't want to do that.
   
                       MAX
             They wanted you to tell them what you
             know.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had 'em too. I burnt those two
             Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
             Then their asses lucked out and found
             that coke.
   
                       MAX
             What did they want to know?
   
                       JACKIE
             Who gave me the money and who I was
             giving it to. And some guy they found
             in a trunk with his head blown off.
             Said it was him who told them 'bout
             me.
   
   The Waitress comes with the drinks.
   
                       ROWEN
             Can I get you two some popcorn?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Rowen exits.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             That would be Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's him. How do you know 'em?
   
                       MAX
             I wrote him on Monday. They found him
             dead on Tuesday.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell pick up his bond?
   
                       MAX
             Same as you. Ten thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             The federal agent kinda half hinted
             Ordell might of done Beaumont.
   
                       MAX
             You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
             but you didn't mention the Federal.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't?
   
                       MAX
             No, you didn't. What branch?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
             and Firearms.
   
   Max puts it together.
   
                       MAX
             He's the one who wants you.
   
                       JACKIE
             It was the other guy who busted me.
   
                       MAX
             'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
             hell bonding out of federal court. He
             doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
             you to tell him what you know. He
             uses you to get a line on Ordell,
             make a case, then take him federal.
             You know what Ordell's into?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
             aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
             smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
             leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
             be interested in.
   
   Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
   her mind and makes a decision.
   
                       JACKIE
             I used to bring over ten thousand at
             a time. That's the legal limit, so I
             never brought more than that.
   
                       MAX
             How many trips did you make?
   
                       JACKIE
             With ten thousand? Nine.
   
                       MAX
             He's got that kinda money?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
             bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
             what do you call it when you got
             money, but don't have cash?
   
                       MAX
             Cash poor?
   
                       JACKIE
             That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
             me till I finally said okay. I'll
             bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
             twelve envelope. I got paid five
             hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
             Walker, in Mexico gave me the
             envelope.
   
                       MAX
             If you knew bringing anything over
             ten thousand was against the law, why
             not pack a hundred grand?
   
   Jackie gets exasperated.
   
                       JACKIE
             Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
             and not hit you in the face if the
             bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
             problem. I gotta figure out a way to
             either keep my job or get out of
             trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
             leave the country I'm out of a job.
             And if I don't got a job, I can't
             hire a lawyer.
   
                       MAX
             Ask A.T.F. They might give you
             permission.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, if I cooperate.
   
                       MAX
             Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
             gonna have to give 'em something.
   
                       JACKIE
             But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
             name - I don't really know shit about
             what he does or how he does it - That
             don't give me much to bargain with.
   
                       MAX
             Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
             Show a willingness to be helpful. You
             want to stay out of jail, don't you?
   
   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             What'dya think?
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             I think maybe I have more options
             than I thought.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP: ORDELL
   
   Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
   from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
   Cash is playing inside his car.
   
   
   EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT
   
   ORDELL'S POV
   
   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
   off.
   
   
   ORDELL
   
   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
   
   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
   moment, then Jackie opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was expecting you. Come in.
   
   Jackie holds the door open for him.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
   the living room.
   
                       ORDELL
             You got some booze?
   
   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
   frightened.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got some vodka in the freezer.
   
                       ORDELL
             Got some o.j.?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, then, why don't you be a good
             hostess and make me a screwdriver?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
   doesn't turn on the light.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna thank me?
   
   Taking a glass from the cupboard.
   
                       JACKIE
             For what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Who you think got your ass outta
             jail?
   
   Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
   and taking out vodka.
   
                       JACKIE
             The same guy who put me in, thanks a
             lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
             our business.
   
   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.
   
                       JACKIE
             It wasn't mine.
   
   Ordell has to stop and think.
   
   Jackie makes screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
             Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
             Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
             there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
             shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
             apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
             shitload of questions about it, huh?
             All that money, want to know where
             you got it?
   
   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'magine they asked who you givin' it
             to, too.
   
                       JACKIE
             They asked.
   
                       ORDELL
             And what was your answer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
   
                       ORDELL
             You positive about that? You weren't
             nervous and let something slip by
             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
             just gotta know.
   
   Jackie says to his face;
   
                       JACKIE
             You're not asking the right
             questions.
   
   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston.
   
                       ORDELL
             I knew it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
   
   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't tell 'em anything.
   
   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL
             My name come up?
   
   Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."
   
   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
   gloved hands on her shoulders.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You say anything about me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no."
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.
   
   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
   his, but still shows no fear.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             This fella Beaumont, they say what
             happened to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             They told me.
   
   At this moment the film becomes a:
   
   
   SPLIT SCREEN
   
   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
   driving home in his Seville.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
   "WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
   COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.
   
   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
   Torrance.
   
   
   ORDELL AND JACKIE
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
             what he might say to keep from doin
             some time. I'magine from time-to-time
             they asked you a whole shitload of
             questions. And you didn't give 'em no
             answer?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.
   
   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
   of her throat.
   
                       ORDELL
             You scared of me?
   
   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
   leaving his. Reaches over the seat
   
                       ORDELL
             You got a reason to be nervous with
             me?
   
   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.
   
   Ordell hears a CLICK.
   
   Can't believe it.
   
   
   MAX IN CAR
   
   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...
   
   
   THE GLOVE BOX
   
   The gun is gone.
   
                       MAX
             Where is it?
   
   
   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             Is that what I think it is?
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you think it is?
   
   
   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH
   
                       ORDELL
             I think it's a gun pressing against
             my dick.
   
                       JACKIE
             You thought right... Now take your
             hands from around my throat, nigga.
   
   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
   
   END OF SPLIT SCREEN
   
   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
   pushes him against the wall.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
   
   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
   pocket
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
             with you. I just carry that. You been
             listenin' to them cops too much.
   
                       JACKIE
             The cops didn't try and strangle my
             ass.
   
                       ORDELL
             Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
             you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
             gonna unload both these
             motherfuckers, you don't do what I
             tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
   
                       ORDELL
             Baby, I ain't come here -
   
   She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
   
                       JACKIE
             I said, you understand what I'm
             saying
   
                       ORDELL
             I understand woman, damn!
   
                       JACKIE
             Go sit over in that chair.
   
   Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
   Ordell still tries bullshit...
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm tellin' you, those cops been
             fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
             black against black, that's how they
             do.
   
                       JACKIE
             Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
             down.
   
   Ordell sits.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Put both hands behind our head.
   
   Ordell does...
   
                       ORDELL
             This shits gettin silly now...
   
   Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta tell you to shut up one more
             time, I'm gonna shut you up.
   
   Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
   hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
   
   A coffee table lays between them.
   
   Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
   
                       ORDELL
             I just came here to talk.
   
                       JACKIE
             Way I see it, me and you only got one
             thing to talk about. What you willing
             to do for me?
   
   Ordell looks at her a moment and says;
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I can get you a good lawyer -
   
   Jackie shakes her head "no!"
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
             later they're gonna get around to
             offering me a plea deal, and you know
             that. That's why you came here to
             kill me.
   
                       ORDELL
             - Baby, I didn't -
   
                       JACKIE
             - It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
             let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
             And if I don't, I go to jail.
   
   Ordell, very interested.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah?
   
                       JACKIE
             One hundred thousand put in an escrow
             account in my name, if I'm convicted
             up to a year, or put on probation. If
             I have to do more than a year, you
             pay another hundred thousand.
   
   Ordell just takes in what the woman said.
   
                       ORDELL
             I got a problem...
   
                       JACKIE
             All your money's in Mexico.
   
   Ordell has to smile at the woman.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah.
   
                       JACKIE
             I been thinkin about that, too, and I
             got me a idea.
   
                                               TIME CUT:
   
   
   DOORWAY
   
   Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
   into FRAME, and talks with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
             tell you if it's on.
   
                       ORDELL (O.S.)
             Talk to you tomorrow.
   
   Ordell leaves.
   
   Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   OVER BLACK
   
   We hear a knock-knock on the door.
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   SAME SHOT DORWAY
   
   Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
   visitor;
   
                       JACKIE
             You want your gun, don't you? Come
             in. I'll go get it.
   
   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
   
   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
   
   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
   of sad smile.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
             asked to borrow it you'd say no.
             You'd have to. Would you like some
             coffee?
   
   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
   completely, leaving only curiosity.
   
                       MAX
             If you're having some.
   
                       JACKIE
             I am. Have a seat.
   
   Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
   at the dining table off of the kitchen.
   
                       MAX
             You get a chance to use it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
             went bad when I was in jail.
   
                       MAX
             Black's fine.
   
   She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
   coffee in it.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You want to hang on to it awhile? It
             wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -
   
   Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks, but I have my own now.
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun?
   
   She turns off the water.
   
                       JACKIE
             What, I couldn't hear you?
   
                       MAX
             You went out this morning and bought
             a gun.
   
   Pouring water into the coffee machine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Let's just say I got one, okay?
   
   She turns on the coffeemaker.
   
                       MAX
             Somebody loan it to you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Jackie leaves the kitchen.
   
   Max's eyes follow her to the living room.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Want to hear some music?
   
                       MAX
             Sure.
   
   Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
   leaned up against the wall on the floor.
   
                       JACKIE
             I couldn't wait till I got home last
             night and wash my hair.
   
                       MAX
             It looks nice.
   
   She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
   album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
   turntable.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You never got into the whole CD
             revolution?
   
                       JACKIE
             I got a few. But I can't afford to
             start all over again. I got too much
             time and money invested in my
             records.
   
   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
   from the early seventies.
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
             records.
   
   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't buy new stuff that often.
   
   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
   cigarette and stands.
   
   Max listens to the soul song.
   
                       MAX
             This is pretty.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Who is this?
   
                       JACKIE
             The Delfonics.
   
                       MAX
             '76?
   
                       JACKIE
             '74, I think.
   
                       MAX
             It's nice.
   
   They listen for a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             I called in sick this morning. As far
             as the airline knows, I'm still
             available.
   
                       MAX
             Are you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
             with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
             what you suggested. Offer to help and
             see what happens.
   
                       MAX
             What I meant was have a lawyer do the
             negotiating for you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I want to talk to them first. I know
             more now about Ordell's money.
   
                       MAX
             Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
             who wants you, that'll only interest
             him up to a point.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
             million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
             safe deposit boxes and more comin in.
   
                       MAX
             How'd you find that out?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me last night.
   
                       MAX
             He called you?
   
                       JACKIE
             He came by.
   
                       MAX
             What?... What'd you do?
   
                       JACKIE
             We talked.
   
   Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
   but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             He had his doubts at first. But he's
             always trusted me an wants more than
             anything to believe he still can.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             He needs me. Without me all that
             money is just gonna sit over there in
             Cabo. Sugar?
   
                       MAX
             No thanks. There's gotta be other
             ways to get it out.
   
   She pours the coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
             used. He can't trust his other
             people. They're crooks. He can try
             bringing I in himself, but Ordell
             sure don't want to go through no
             Customs line. Either he recruits
             another Cabo stewardess, or he
             continues to trust me. I made him
             feel he still can.
   
   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
   sits down.
   
                       MAX
             How do you get it out?
   
                       JACKIE
             Same way I been don', but first they
             got to let me go back to work.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna offer to set him up?
   
                       JACKIE
             If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
             'em.
   
                       MAX
             It's very possible Ordell's killed
             somebody.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
             doin' that probation thing again.
   
   Max watches her a moment
   
   Jackie takes a drink of coffee.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             How do you feel about getting old?
   
                       MAX
             You're not old. You look great.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm asking how you feel. Does it
             bother you?
   
                       MAX
             It's not really something I think
             about.
   
                       JACKIE
             Really?
   
                       MAX
             Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
             hair. It started falling out ten
             years ago. So I did something about
             it.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you feel about it?
   
                       MAX
             I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
             done it, I did it to feel better
             about myself, and I do. When I look
             in the mirror it looks like me.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's different with men.
   
                       MAX
             You know, I can't really feel too
             sorry for you in that department.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             In fact, I'd make a bet that except
             possibly for an Afro - you look
             exactly the same as you did at twenty
             nine.
   
   Jackie smiles into her coffee.
   
                       JACKIE
             My ass ain't the same.
   
                       MAX
             Bigger?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       MAX
             Nothin wrong with that.
   
   Jackie's smile grows bigger.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Does something else worry you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I just feel like I'm always starting
             over. You said how many bonds you
             wrote?
   
                       MAX
             Fifteen thousand.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I've flown seven million miles.
             And I've been waitin' on people
             almost twenty years. The best job I
             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
             which is about the worst job you can
             get in this industry. I make about
             sixteen thousand, with retirement
             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
             now with this arrest hanging over my
             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
             gotta start all over again, but I got
             nothin to start over with. I'll be
             stuck with whatever I can get. And
             that scares me more than Ordell.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY
   
   A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the
   big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus.
   
   He reaches the closed door... raps on it.
   
                       DARGUS (O.S.)
             Come in.
   
   Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
   sitting in the office talking.
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Great, you're here.
   
                       NICOLET
             Hey, Jackie.
   
   Jackie waves.
   
   Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;
   
                       DARGUS
             Let me have a word outside with Agent
             Nicolet for a moment?
   
                       JACKIE
             Take your time.
   
                       DARGUS
             Thanks.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well just be a minute.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can I smoke?
   
                       DARGUS
             Go ahead.
   
   The two detectives step outside and close the door on
   Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's going on?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to make a deal.
   
                       NICOLET
             She sound scared?
   
                       DARGUS
             She almost sounds scared.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she want?
   
                       DARGUS
             She wants to go back to work.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's she willing to give us?
   
                       DARGUS
             She hasn't one into specifics yet,
             she's been waiting for you.
   
                       NICOLET
             She knows it's my case?
   
                       DARGUS
             She ain't said it, but she's not
             stupid, she knows it's you who wants
             her.
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.
   
   Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.
   
                       NICOLET
             Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
             me, what can we do for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need permission to leave the
             country so I keep my job.
   
                       NICOLET
             We can look into that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
             up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
   
                       NICOLET
             You know what we want.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I'm working, I can help you.
   
                       DARGUS
             Help us do what?
   
                       JACKIE
             Help you get Ordell Robbie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, so now you know him?
   
                       JACKIE
             You never asked me if I did or not.
   
                       DARGUS
             But now you're telling us now you do.
   
                       JACKIE
             'Course I do - I deliver money for
             him.
   
                       NICOLET
             No shit. You know how he makes hi
             money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He sells guns.
   
                       NICOLET
             You ever see him sell guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             No.
   
                       NICOLET
             Then how do you know he sells guns?
   
                       JACKIE
             He told me. Besides, why else would
             an A.T.F. man be after him?
   
                       NICOLET
             How can you help us?
   
                       JACKIE
             Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
             everything I can to help you throw
             his ass in jail. And in exchange for
             my help, I need permission to leave
             the country and immunity.
   
                       DARGUS
             You don't want much, do you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you do it or not?
   
   The two cops look at each other.
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             It's your call.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLE
             It's possible.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "LOUIS GARA & MELANIE"
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   FADE UP ON ON TV
   
   Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
   proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
   Policier from the seventies.
   
   Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
   hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
   a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
   Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
   and a loose top.
   
   The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
   it carrying shopping bags.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're back.
   
                       MELANIE
             'Ola!
   
   We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
   "look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
   jeans.
   
   Melanie notices the change.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got
             some new clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
             running around lookin' like a bum on
             the street.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't look like a bum.
   
                       ORDELL
             But you did have a Salvation Army-
             thing going.
   
   Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
   air.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
             already. It's only two o'clock.
   
   Melanie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's that late?
   
   Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.
   
                       ORDELL
             Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
             much of that shit. That shit robs you
             of your ambition.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not if your ambition is to get high
             and watch TV.
   
   Melanie and Louis laugh.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       ORDELL
             You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
             ain't ya.
                   (he moves towards the
                   phone - to Melanie)
             Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.
   
   He picks it up.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
                   (pause)
             Hey, Jackie...
                   (throwing a hard look at
                   Melanie)
   
   No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was gonna tell you...
   
   Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.
   
   Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
   all the while smiling like a shark.
   
   Louis smiles to himself.
   
   Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
             No, not on the phone, let's meet
             somewhere. But you gotta make sure
             they ain't followin' you...
   
   Louis has the bong in front of him.
   
   Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.
   
                       LOUIS
             Is it ready to go?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah, there's another hit left.
   
   Louis takes it.
   
   Ordell's on the phone.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN
   
   Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
   both sides.
   
                       JACKIE
             The Cockatoo Inn.
   
                       ORDELL
             The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
             Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
             brick...
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, wait, you mean that place that
             has the big sign with a rooster on
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's a cockatoo.
   
   Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.
   
                       MELANIE
             You okay?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
             smoke or laugh now it seems without
             coughing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Coughing opens up the capillaries.
             When you cough, you're getting air -
             in this case smoke - to parts of the
             lung that don't normally get used.
             Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
             dad coughs when he smokes all the
             time.
   
   Ordell hangs up the phone.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Louis)
             Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
             So since you like gettin' high so
             much, why don't you stay here with
             Melanie, get high, and watch
             cartoons?
   
   Louis with a smile.
   
                       LOUIS
             Way ahead of you.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
   Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
   till he finds a channel with cartoons.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you just watch this for the next
             three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
             when I'm through with all my
             business, I'll get high. I get high
             at night. Walk me to the door, space
             girl.
   
   Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
   door,
   
   Ordell says to her in the doorway;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hope you don't mind keeping him
             company.
   
                       MELANIE
             No problem.
   
                       ORDELL
             Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
             they're new.
   
   Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
   look.
   
   Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
             hang with Mel.
   
   Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
   around and looks at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Want a Metrix?
   
                       LOUIS
             What's a Metrix?
   
   She crosses to the kitchen.
   
                       MELANIE
             It's like this major meal in a shake
             you drink instead of having a big
             meal.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's a diet thing?
   
                       MELANIE
             No, it's what body builders drink to
             beef up.
   
                       LOUIS
             No thanks.
   
   She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
   shake.
   
   He looks around and spots something interesting.
   
   
   TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS
   
   In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
   sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
   setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
   style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
   face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
   somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
   disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.
   
   Louis picks up the photo frame.
   
                       LOUIS
             How old were you here?
   
   She looks and sees what he's talking about.
   
                       MELANIE
             Which one?
   
                       LOUIS
             The roller disco one.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fourteen.
   
   Louis walks over.
   
                       LOUIS
             You're fourteen years old here?
   
                       MELANIE
             Yeah.
   
                       LOUIS
             I thought you were sixteen.
   
                       MELANIE
             I was pretty much the same height now
             as I was then.
   
                       LOUIS
             Were you a disco girl?
   
                       MELANIE
             Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
             I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
             discos.
   
                       LOUIS
             So where did you go?
   
                       MELANIE
             The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
             a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
             girl. I hated disco.
   
   She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
   till she hits Stop!
   
   Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
   looks at the picture.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             That was taken at a place called
             "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were
             you in L.A. back then?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             Where were you?
   
                       LOUIS
             Detroit.
   
                       MELANIE
             With Ordell?
   
                       LOUIS
             We had done time together already.
   
   Melanie drinks her Metrix.
   
                       MELANIE
             Were you a disco guy?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             C'mon, don't lie.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't like dancing.
   
                       MELANIE
             Did you ever go I one?
   
                       LOUIS
             I went to a few just to meet women.
             But I don't like to dance, and it's
             so fuckin; loud. During that whole
             scene I just drank in bars.
                   (he points to the cut
                   picture)
             Who didn't make the cut?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a picture of me in Japan.
   
                       LOUIS
             You been to Japan?
   
                       MELANIE
             I lived there for about nine months.
   
                       LOUIS
             You lived in Japan, when?
   
                       MELANIE
             About five years ago.
   
                       LOUIS
             Who's arm is that?
   
                       MELANIE
             That's the guy I lived with... his
             name was... Hir.Hirosh.
   
                       LOUIS
             Must of made quite an impression.
   
                       MEALINE
             I never got to know him, really. I
             couldn't speak Japanese, and his
             English was terrible. But I couldn't
             say anything, because his English was
             better than my Japanese.
   
                       LOUIS
             That sounds like a problem.
   
                       MELANIE
             Not really. We didn't have much to
             say to each other anyway. I never got
             to know him that well, but I knew
             enough to know I wasn't missing much.
             I keep that, because of all the
             fuckin' time I was there, that's the
             only picture I got of me in Japan.
                   (she points beyond her
                   shoulder)
             That's Japan.
   
   Melanie looks up at Louis.
   
                       MELANIE
             Wanna fuck?
   
                       LOUIS
             Sure.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK

                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   LOUIS
   
   Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
   him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys.
   Almost on the fade up, Louis cums.
   
                       MELANIE
             That was fun.
   
   She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, that really hit the spot.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Now that's over, let's get to know
             each other.
   
   
   INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
   through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the
   DELFONICS."
   
   Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store.
   He lifts out the CD and turns it over.
   
   It has the song Jackie played this morning.
   
   He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.
   
   CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.
   
   
   INT. THE COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
   middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
   drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
   jukebox. He sits next to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             I gotta remember this place. This is
             all right. Two minutes from your
             crib, ten minutes from your work. Not
             bad...
   
   A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.
   
                       FLOYD
             What's your drink, brother?
   
                       ORDELL
             Screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
                   (to Jackie)
             How you doin'?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm fine.
   
                       FLOYD
             Yes, you are.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
   Floyd makes Ordell's drink.
   
                       ORDELL
             I bet you come here on a Saturday
             night, you need nigga repellent keep
             'em off your ass.
   
                       JACKIE
             I do okay.
   
                       ORDELL
             You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
             bet you do a damn sight better than
             okay. You think anybody followed you?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't think so, but it don't really
             matter. They know I'm meeting you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck they know that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them.
   
   Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.
   
                       FLOYD
             Three twenty-five.
   
   Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.
   
                       ORDELL
             Keep it.
   
                       FLOYD
             Thank you, sir.
   
   Floyd leaves.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to Jackie)
             You told em? You told em it's me?
   
                       JACKIE
             They already know it's you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
             confirm it!
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, the only way I can get
             permission to fly is if I agree to
             help them. Which is what I have to
             appear to be doing. So I give them
             something they already know. You.
   
                       ORDELL
             Didja tell 'em anything else?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them you got a half a million
             dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
             bring it here.
   
   Ordell freaks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You told them that?
   
                       JACKIE
             It's true, isn't it?
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck's that got to do with
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They know I'm delivering for you. I
             mention the half-million - they don't
             give a fuck about that - They want
             you with guns. So I say, well, if you
             want proof he's getting paid for
             selling them, let me bring the money
             in.
   
                       ORDELL
             What did they say?
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes.
   
   Ordell smiles.
   
   They both slap palms.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY
   
   CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.
   
   Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
   back, taking bong hits.
   
   As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;
   
                       MELANI
             ... so first he tries to get into the
             cocaine business but realizes right
             away that shit's too competitive.
             Piss the wrong person off, you get
             shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
             over to guns. You can sell guns
             wherever there's a demand. No one
             gives a shit. He acts like he's this
             big international arms dealer, when,
             come on, the only people he ever sold
             to were dopers.
   
   Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
   the coffee table to Melanie.
   
                       LOUIS
             He seems to be making out.
   
   Referring to the bong.
   
                       MELANIE
             Is it dead?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah.
   
   She starts preparing a bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             Well, so far he is. But you have to
             admit he's not too bright.
   
                       LOUIS
             I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
   
   Melanie still preparing her bowl.
   
                       MELANIE
             He moves his lips when he reads, what
             does that tell ya. Let's say he's
             streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
             still a fuck-up.
   
   She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
   while holding in the smoke, says;
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a man worked for him the
             other night.
   
                       LOUIS
             So what are you trying to tell me? I
             should get out of here?
   
   Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
   shark smile.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's not what I'm saying at all.
             (pause) You know where he went?
   
                       LOUIS
             No.
   
                       MELANIE
             He went to meet that stewardess.
   
                       LOUIS
             Does that bother you?
   
   Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.
   
                       MELANIE
             Please.
   
                       LOUIS
             You live with him.
   
                       MELANIE
             I live here. He drops in and out. He
             tell you about that half-million
             dollars he's got in Mexico?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANIE
             Course he did, he tells everybody
             who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
             with this stewardess. He's scheming
             how he can get it over here.
   
                       LOUIS
             And your point is?
   
                       MELANIE
             Let him and that stewardess get that
             money over here...
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh?
   
                       MELANI
             ... and just take it from him.
   
   
   INT. COCKATOO INN - DAY
   
   Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.
   
                       JACKI
             ... I make two deliveries. The first
             one with ten thousand, like a dry
             run. They watch it. See how it works.
             Then we do a second delivery, when I
             bring in the half mill.
   
                       ORDELL
             Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
             ain't goin anywhere near that money.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't have to. I told 'em you're
             real careful. You never pick up money
             yourself. You always send someone,
             and I never know who it is.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's a good idea.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you just listen, you'll see it's a
             damn good idea. The first time I do
             it they're lurking about. They see me
             hand the ten thousand to someone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who?
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't know. One of your friends.
   
                       ORDELL
             A woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             If you want.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, I think a woman.
   
                       JACKIE
             The next trip, when I come with all
             the money, it'll look like I hand it
             to the same one I did before...
   
                       ORDELL
             But you don't?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I give it to someone else first.
   
                       ORDELL
             And they follow the wrong one
             thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's the idea.
   
                       ORDELL
             So we need two people, two women.
   
                       JACKIE
             Can you cover that?
   
                       ORDELL
             I got the woman covered. Where you
             thinkin' about doin' this?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
             the food court.
   
                       ORDELL
             I suppose you see a piece of this for
             yourself?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, it's my plan. We're in this
             together.
   
                       ORDELL
             Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
             need me a partner.
   
                       JACKIE
             I ain't your partner, I'm your
             manager. I'm managing to get your
             money out of Mexico, into America, in
             your hands, and I'm managing to do
             all this under the nose of the cops.
             That makes me your manager, and
             managers get fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             Managers get ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's an agent. Manager's get
             fifteen percent.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'll give ya ten.
   
                       JACKIE
             Plus the same deal as before.
   
                       ORDELL
             I can do that.
   
   They clink their glasses together.
   
   
   CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK
   
   It flips to 11:00 P.M.
   
   It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
   dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
   fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.
   
   She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
   takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
   the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
   flashing. She hits play.
   
   We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never
   seeing Jackie again.
   
   The machine voice says;
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             You have on message. Sent at 8:06
             P.M.
   
   Max's voice comes out of the machine.
   
                       MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
             calling to find out how everything
             went today with A.T.F. If you want to
             call me, my home number is 555-6788,
             or you can reach me at my office,
             which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on
             the card I gave you when we first met
             - I don't know if you still have that
             - but it's on it - Oh, let me give
             you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.
             Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope
             everything's well. Bye-bye.
   
                       MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
             End of message.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
                                               FADE UP ON:
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.
   
   A SUBTITLE reads:
   
   "DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
   THE WORLD"
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
   week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
   not like it is on the weekend.
   
   The international food court, where fast-food versions of
   international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
   Amo Mall shoppers.
   
   Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
   drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
   Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.
   
   We join in mid-conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             The money's in a Broadway shopping
             bag. I get some food, and sit down
             here in the food court. Then your
             girl comes - you got somebody yet?
   
                       ORDELL
             Uh-huh.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who?
   
                       ORDELL
             What'd you care?
   
                       JACKIE
             Look, it's my ass facin' the
             penitentiary. You send some hard-
             headed roc whore, and she fucks
             things up.
   
                       ORDELL
             I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
             woman's cool, I promise.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY
   
   We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
   theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
   seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
   having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
   them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL
   
   In the food court.
   
   Ordell rises from the table.
   
   Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't forget your bag.
   
   He takes it.
   
   We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
   stops...
   
   ... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.
   
   Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
   "What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"
   
   As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
   court.
   
                       MAX
             walks into the food court. He stands
             looking a all the international fast
             food choices in front of him. As he
             tries to decide, he hears from behind
             him;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Max.
   
   Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
   tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Well, hello.
   
                       JACKIE
             Surprise.
   
   He approaches her table.
   
                       MAX
             I walked right past you.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, ignoring me. What're you up
             to?
   
                       MAX
             Catching a movie.
   
                       JACKIE
             What'd ya see?
   
                       MAX
             "American Prseident"
   
                       JACKIE
             How was it?
   
                       MAX
             Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
             are goin steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, are you? Does she know that?
   
                       MAX
             No...
                   (sitting down at the
                   table)
             ... I don't believe she's ever heard
             of me. But that doesn't mean we're
             not going steady.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
   Jackie's table.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (to himself)
             What's up with this shit.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             I think falling in live with movie
             stars is something that happens to a
             man as he gets older.
   
                       JACKIE
             Does it happen to all men?
   
                       MAX
             Well, I'd never be so bold as to
             speak for all men, but as or myself
             and a few of my friends, that's
             definitely the case. There's a lot of
             actresses out there you like, and
             there's some you have crushes on. But
             there's always one who you love. And
             with her it's sorta like going
             steady.
   
                       JACKIE
             And Annette's it for you?
   
                       MAX
             For now. These relationships never
             last too long.
   
   With a smile on her face;
   
                       JACKIE
             That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
             even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
             star.
   
   Max smiles.
   
                       JACKIE
             Who was your girl before Annette?
   
                       MAX
             Sandra Bullock. You know her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
             bus in "Speed." She's cute.
   
                       MAX
             She's adorable. But I had to end it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             I'm old enough to be her father.
   
                       JACKIE
             How old's Annette?
   
                       MAX
             I don't care.
   
   Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.
   
                       MAX
             What're you, a bag lady?
   
                       JACKIE
             I go back to work tomorrow.
   
                       MAX
             You talk them into it?
   
                       JACKIE
             They seem to like the idea.
   
                       MAX
             Bring the money in and they follow
             it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
             Put the money in a shopping bag and
             hand it to someone I meet here.
   
                       MAX
             You don't actually do it that way?
   
                       JACKIE
             He always just picked it up at my
             place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
             want to stage it. You know, make it
             look more intriguing, like we know
             what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
             up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
             follow the shopping bag.
   
                       MAX
             Make the delivery somewhere in the
             mall.
   
                       JACKIE
             Right around here, in the food court.
   
                       MAX
             Sit down, leave the bag under the
             table?
   
   Jackie nods her head "yes."
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             Will Ordell go for that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm helping him bring his money into
             America. He loves the idea. You just
             missed him.
   
                       MAX
             He was here?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
             That's why all the bags.
   
                       MAX
             I called you last night.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, I got your message. Ray
             wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
             talk about the sting we're plotting.
             That's what he calls it. A sting.
             He's being real nice to me.
   
                       MAX
             You think he's got a thing for you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
             something like he wants the money for
             himself.
   
                       MAX
             I don't follow your logic. What does
             his being nice to you have to do with
             him wanting Ordell's money?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's setting me up to make a
             proposition.
   
                       MAX
             I see.
   
                       JACKIE
             You don't propose something like that
             unless you're pretty sure the other
             person's into it.
   
                       MAX
             Has he hinted around?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. But I knew this narcotics
             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
             the whole package never gets back to
             the station. His exact words.
   
                       MAX
             You know some interesting people.
   
                       JACKIE
             We weren't bullshittin' either,
             'cause later he was suspended and
             forced to retire.
   
                       MAX
             Has Nicolet told you any colorful
             stories like that?
   
   She shakes her head "no."
   
                       JACKIE
             He tries to act cool.
   
                       MAX
             No harm in that. He's a young guy
             havin' fun being a cop. I know the
             type, trust me on this. He's more
             interested in Ordell than the money.
             If he's gonna do anything suspect,
             it'll be cutting corners to get the
             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
             with the money. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about you Max?
   
                       MAX
             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
   
                       JACKIE
             No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
             were somebody else.
   
                       MAX
             If I saw a way to walk off with a
             shopping bag full of money, would I
             take it?
   
                       JACKIE
             You know where it came from. It's not
             like it's anybody's life savings. It
             wouldn't even be missed.
   
                       MAX
             A half-a-million dollars will always
             be missed.
   
                       JACKIE
             You're avoiding the question.
   
                       MAX
             Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
             Especially now, since I'm getting out
             of the bail bonds business.
   
   Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
   doesn't say anything.
   
   Max continues.
   
                       MAX
             I have to stand behind all my active
             bonds, but I'm not writing any new
             ones.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why?
   
                       MAX
             A lot of reasons. But the main one
             would be I'm tired of it.
   
                       JACKIE
             When did you decide?
   
                       MAX
             It's been a long time coming. I
             finally made up my mind - I guess it
             was Thursday.
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   A RELEASE FORM
   
   With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
   WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
   her, handing her his business card.
   
                       MAX
             Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
             bondsman.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             The day you got me out of jail?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
             guy. I hear he's staying at this
             house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
             come home.
   
                       JACKIE
             Wait a minute. After we were together
             you went and snuck into a guy's
             house?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
   
   FLASH ON
   
   Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
   goodbye.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             I dropped you off...
   
   Max finding no gun in his glove box.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Went to my office, found out you took
             my gun...
   
   Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
   and a stun gun.
   
                       MAX (V.O.)
             Got another gun and a stun gun...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE
   
                       MAX
             And went to this guy's house in El
             Monte, and I waited for him.
   
                       JACKIE
             What do you do when he comes home?
   
                       MAX
             Shoot him with the stun gun. While
             he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
             'em to County.
   
                       JACKIE
             You do that?
   
                       MAX
             That's my job.
   
                       JACKIE
             Did you do it that night?
   
                       MAX
             He never came home. But I'm sitting
             on the couch, in the dark, holding my
             stun gun and the whole house smells
             of mildew - So after a couple hours I
             think, "What am I doing here?
             Nineteen years of this shit? So I
             made up my mind, that's it.
   
                       JACKIE
             And is that it?
   
                       MAX
             More or less.
   
   Jackie takes a pause before saying;
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm not sure you answered my
             question.
   
                       MAX
             Which one?
   
                       JACKIE
             If you had a chance, unemployed now,
             to walk off with a half-million
             dollars, would you take it?
   
                       MAX
             I believe I said I'd be tempted.
   
   Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.
   
                       MAX
             Don't even think about it. You could
             get yourself killed go to prison...
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             What if I've figured a way?
   
   Hold for a few beats, then...
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK.
   
   
   TITLE CARD:
   
   "MONEY EXCHANGE 10,000"
   
   Over this card, we hear an airplane landing.
   
                                               FADE UP:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Back at work, standing at the exit of her plane. All the
   passengers are filtering out. She says goodbye.
   
                       JACKIE
             Bye bye... Bye now... Goodbye Bye
             bye... Bye bye... Goodbye
   
   
   INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY
   
   Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
   LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
   her.
   
   Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.
   
                       NICOLET
             We gotta stop meeting this way.
   
   Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
   Honda.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
   She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
   passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
   flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
   envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
   very different from the first time they met. The three
   now almost act like friends.
   
                       DARGUS
             How was your flight?
   
                       JACKIE
             Fine.
   
                       DARGUS
             Bet you're happy to be working again.
   
                       NICOLET
             This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
             Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
             exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
             July 4th 1997. The location is the
             parking structure at LAX.
   
                       JACKIE
             What are you doing?
   
   Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm recording this.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were going to let this
             one through.
   
                       DARGUS
             We are. Don't worry about it.
   
                       NICOLET
             Every step of this goes in my report.
                   (back to report voice)
             I am now taking a manila envelope
             from the subject's flight bag.
   
   He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             The envelope contains currency... all
             the same denomination, one-hundred-
             dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
   
                       DARGUS
             What time do you have to be there?
   
                       JACKIE
             Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
   
                       DARGUS
             What's her name?
   
                       JACKIE
             He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
             her?
   
                       DARGUS
             She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
   
                       JACKIE
             But you're not going to stop her?
   
   Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.
   
                       NICOLET
             The envelope contains ten thousand
             dollars. The subject will be
             delivering the currency in a...
   
                       JACKIE
             A Broadway shopping bag.
   
   She holds it up.
   
                       NICOLET
             A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
             with handles and brown lettering.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   The huge Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of
   the week.
   
   Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually
   strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar
   called "BUSTA CAP" across from the food court. Walking up
   to the counter;
   
                       MAX
             CafŠ mocha.
   
                       BUSTA CAP GIRL
             You want whipped cream on that?
   
                       MAX
             No, thanks.
   
   Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food
   court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-
   shirt and panties).
   
                       JACKIE
             Think of it as money that shouldn't
             even be here. I mean does anybody
             have a right to it?
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max in his office on the phone.
   
                       MAX
             The feds. It's evidence.
   
                       JACKIE
             It may be evidence once they get
             their hands on it, but right now it's
             only money.
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL
   
   He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.
   
   
   INT. FOOD COURT - DAY
   
   Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food
   from Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats
   she hears;
   
                       YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
             Is this seat taken?
   
   Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black,
   quite pretty, no older than twenty.
   
   She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
   beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway
   shopping bag hanging from her arm.
   
                       JACKIE
             Have a seat.
   
   The Young Girl does.
   
   Jackie looks at her tray of food.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             You're hungry?
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Yes'm.
   
   It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.
   
                       JACKIE
             Put your bag on the floor, okay?
             Under the table, right next to mine.
   
   The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since
   sitting down, bends sideways to glance under the table.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Then when I leave, well, you know.
             What's your name?
   
   She looks up...
   
                       YOUNG GIRL
             Sherona?
   
   ... then back down at her tray.
   
                       JACKIE
             Go ahead, start eating.
   
   Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
   tray.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Would it bother you if I smoked?
   
   Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to
   side.
   
   Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up
   with her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes
   Sheronda eating.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
             Are you and Ordell married?
   
   Without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say we like the same thing as
             married.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you live together?
   
   Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Most of the times.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not every day?
   
   Sheronda looks up at her...
   
                       SHERONDA
             Sometimes every day, for a while.
   
                       JACKIE
             Then you don't see him for a few
             days?
   
   ... She looks back down.
   
                       SHERONDA
             Yes'm.
   
                       JACKIE
             You know what's in the bag you're
             taking?
   
                       SHERONDA
             He say is a surprise.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
             to you.
   
   Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - BUSTA CAP - DAY
   
   Max drinking his cafŠ mocha sans whipped cream, watches
   Jackie leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in
   hand, walk out of the food court.
   
   Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
   sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
   Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
   serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
   nods her head again, and then walks off.
   
   As he watches her walk away from the cops...
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE
   
                       JACKIE
             You said it yourself. Ray wants
             Ordell, he don't give a shit about
             the money. Money won't convict him,
             guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in
             their lap, they take it. If they know
             they got it, they'll look for it...
             but if they don't...
   
   
   BACK TO MAX AT MALL
   
   Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
   young girl eating in the food court.
   
   Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
   her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
   to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
   older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
   her the ashtray Jackie was using.
   
   Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
   from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
   shopping bag and walks out of the food court.
   
   Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
   little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.
   
   Max turns back on the older woman all alone.
   
   She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
   carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
   woman heads out of the mall.
   
   Max follows her.
   
   The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
   exit.
   
   
   EXT. DEL AMO MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY
   
   Max follows the woman outside.
   
   She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
   Mercury sedan. She drives of...
   
   ... but not before Max writes down her license plate
   number.
   
   FLASH ON:
   
   
   MAX AND JACKIE ON PHONE
   
                       MAX
             You're rationalizing.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's what you do to go through with
             the shit you start. You rationalize.
             I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
             I can't do it without you.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - DAY
   
   Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives
   out of the parking lot.
   
   
   CLOSEUP MAX
   
   Driving down the street, lost in thought.
   
                       MAX
                   (to himself)
             It could work... If she handles the
             cops right, I could work...
   
   He hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill
   the cab of the Caddy.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   BLACK
   
   A garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis.
   
   
   EXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
   VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
   pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             Check this out.
   
   He turns on the flashlight.
   
   He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
   filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
   rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.
   
                       LOUIS
             How much is there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Over half-million dollars worth of
             merchandise.
   
   Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
   unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.
   
                       LOUIS
             Can I ask you about Melanie?
   
                       ORDELL
             Sure.
   
                       LOUIS
             What's your relationship?
   
                       ORDELL
             She one of the women I got set up. I
             got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
             Simone a small house in Compton, and
             about four blocks away I got me this
             nineteen-year-old country girl named
             Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
             bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
             country as a chicken coop. Took her
             to my house in Compton, told her it
             was Hollywood.
   
                       LOUIS
             She believed you?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
             Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
             ever been, anyway.
   
   They both laugh together.
   
                       LOUIS
             Do you trust Melanie?
   
   Ordell stops unloading.
   
                       ORDELL
             If this is about you fucked Melanie,
             I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
             I leave you alone with a bitch like
             Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
             twenty minutes after I'm out the
             door. So say "thank you" and I'll
             tell you, "you're welcome."
   
                       LOUIS
             That's not what I meant when I asked
             did you trust her.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             She tryin' to work your ass against
             me, ain't she?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You didn't even hafta say it. I know
             the woman.
   
                       LOUIS
             Well, why the fuck keep her around?
   
                       ORDELL
                   (smiling)
             'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
             She can't do me no harm. Fact she
             think she can play you against me
             shows how little she knows. You could
             teach that bitch for days how it is
             'tween me an you, she never
             understand a damn word.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why do you let someone know your
             business you can't trust?
   
                       ORDELL
             I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
   
                       LOUIS
             What does that mean?
   
                       ORDELL
             You can't trust Melanie. But you can
             always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
   
   Louis starts unloading.
   
                       LOUIS
             I still don't understand why you keep
             her around.
   
                       ORDELL
             I told you, man.
                   (smiling)
             She my fine little surfer gal.
   
   
   EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black
   button next to the
   handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."
   
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX
   
                       MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   (coming out of it)
             What?
   
   
   JACKIE
   
   Bends down to talk in the speaker.
   
                       JACKIE
             It's Jackie.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY
   
   Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.
   
   She rings the doorbell.
   
   The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on
   the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs,
   doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away.
   
   Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
   apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;
   
                       ORDEL
             ... Now she's gonna pout...
   
   He turns his attention to Jackie.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.
   
   Jackie steps inside.
   
   She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.
   
   Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
   other room to hear;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             She gonna hafta find her sandals...
             find her bag... find her
             sunglasses... take twenty damn
             minutes get her ass out the door.
                   (to Jackie)
             Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -
             Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
             in the other room is Melanie.
   
   Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
   sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
   her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
   saying nothin' to nobody.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             You have a nice time, hear?
   
   The door SLAMS behind her.
   
   Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Drink?
   
                       JACKIE
             I need to talk to you alone.
   
   
   EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.
   
                       JACKIE
             I don't want no more fuckin'
             surprises. We do this the way I laid
             it out, or we don't do it at all.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the hell you talkin' bout?
   
                       JACKIE
             Sheronda passin' the money onto
             someone else, that's what the hell
             I'm talkin' 'bout.
   
                       ORDELL
             How do you know she did that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I was there, I saw her do it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, you weren't supposed to be
             there.
   
                       JACKIE
             I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
             figured you'd try an' pull some shit
             like this.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
             no shit. It's my money, I can do
             whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not when it's my ass on the line you
             don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
   
   Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.
   
                       ORDELL
             Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
             ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
             was my friend, Simone. She's the one
             gonna be receiving the money, so I
             just wanted her to see how it works.
             She'll be here any minute. Nice
             woman, you'll like her.
   
   Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
   living room;
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, call Simone and tell her to
             get her tail over here. We're waitin'
             on her ass.
   
   Louis gets up to make the call.
   
   Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
   screwdriver.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
             can't tempt you?
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
   counter/bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
             airport and mark the bills.
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't like that part.
   
                       JACKIE
             It washes off. I tell them we're
             doing it the same way as before.
             They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
             idea of leaving her for a fall.
   
                       ORDELL
             She won't have no problems 'cause she
             don't know nothin'.
   
                       JACKIE
             Are you sure she don' know about the
             money?
   
                       ORDELL
             She don't know shit about the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             What does she think she's gettin?
   
                       ORDELL
             I told her this is a game us rich
             folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
             scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
             that was neither.
                   (to Louis)
             No answer?
   
   Louis shakes his head.
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Hang it up, she's on her way. You
             gotta listen to this. This involves
             you.
   
   Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             No, you gonna give her a
             Robinson's/May bag this time?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right, the one Simone gives me.
             Simone and I'll make the switch at
             Robinson's/May. She knows what I look
             like?
   
                       ORDELL
             She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
             goes to the dress department with her
             Robinson's/May bag.
   
                       JACKIE
             Designer clothes.
   
                       ORDELL
             She waits for you to go in the place
             where you try things on.
   
                       JACKIE
             The fitting room. There's a sign over
             the door.
   
                       LOUIS
             Why we doin' I there?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
             me. We can't risk switching bags out
             in the open or even in the dining
             area. That's why it has to be a
             woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
             fitting room.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you come out with her
             Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda.
             Simone peeks out, waits for my man
             Louis here to give her a signal
             nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
             store, gets in her car - mission
             accomplished.
   
                       JACKIE
             Where you gonna be during all this?
   
                       ORDELL
             I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar
             In downtown L.A. till my man over
             here calls me and gives me the O.K.
             sign.
   
   Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.
   
                       JACKIE
             I gotta go.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY
   
   Ordell walks Jackie to the elevator.
   
                       ORDELL
             Who's paging you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
   
                       ORDELL
             That works on my nerves, you bein' so
             buddy-buddy with him.
   
                       JACKIE
             If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
             once I deliver I'll have to trust
             you.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, I've been trusting you all this
             time, haven't I? We agreed on ten
             percent of what you bring in and
             that's what you gonna get.
   
   They reach the elevator. She presses the button.
   
                       JACKIE
             And a hundred thousand if I go to
             jail.
   
                       ORDELL
             We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
             gonna screw you. You haven't told me
             where I put it for you.
   
   The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.
   
                       JACKIE
             Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
             Cherry. He'll take care of it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
             You tell him about this shit?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't know where the money came
             from. Only that it's money.
   
   ... the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;...
   
                       ORDELL
             Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
             are crooks...
   
   ... the door shuts.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He doesn't like the last piece of new information.
   
   
   EXT. THE STRAND - DAY
   
   The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
   Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
   her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
   "Sally Leroy's."
   
   
   INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY
   
   Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
   beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
   Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
   monster waves all over the place.
   
   The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.
   
   
   BEGINNING OF SHOT
   
   The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
   into the place and going up to the bar...
   
   A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
   workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you have a phone?
   
                       WANDA
             Yeah, it's in the back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks.
   
   ... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
   MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
   older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
   like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
   As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
   head of hair comes into the f.g....
   
   The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
   on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
   Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.
   
   END OF SHOT
   
   Jackie hears behind her;
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Hey!
   
   Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
   behind her.
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, hi.
   
                       MELANIE
             Buy ya a beer?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm waiting for the phone.
   
                       MELANIE
             Good luck. That guy's been in there
             since I got here.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, I guess I better look for
             another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
   
   Jackie turns to leave.
   
                       MELANIE
             I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
             You sit down and have a beer with me.
             I'll tell you a secret.
   
   Jackie looks at her a moment.
   
                       JACKIE
             Sure.
   
                       MELANIE
             Great...
                   (calling to the
                   bartender)
             ... Wanda!
   
   Wanda approaches.
   
                       WANDA
             What?
   
                       MELANIE
             This lady is thirsty.
   
                       WANDA
             What do you want?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's on tap?
   
                       WANDA
             Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
             Killian's Red.
   
                       JACKIE
             Killian's.
   
                       MELANIE
             Better get me another Sam's.
                   (to Jackie)
             Join me in a Jaeger shot?
   

                       JACKIE
             Uh-uh.
             
                       MELANIE
             Gimme one anyway.
   
                       WANDA
             You got it.
             
   Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The
   MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie
   moves her head to it during the conversation.
   
                       JACKIE
             How long you been with Ordell?
   
                       MELANIE
             This time? Almost a year. I've known
             him forever.
   
                       JACKIE
             What were you two fighting about?
   
                       MELANIE
             He told me to go outside.
                   (imitating Ordell's
                   voice)
             "You may leave us now." It's all part
             of his pathetic attempt to be "the
             man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
   
   Jackie nods "yes."
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
             Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             That coke was yours, wasn't it?
   
   Melanie makes a face to show pain.
   
                       MELANIE
             Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
             that. I hope they don't come down on
             you on my account. Ordell shoulda
             told you it was in your bag.
   
   Wanda brings the drinks.
   
                       WANDA
             Seven dollars.
   
   Melanie digs in her purse for the money.
   
                       JACKIE
             He said he didn't know about it.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (digging in her purse)
             You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
             you have to trust him.
                   (pulls out a ten)
             I'd have second thoughts on that, but
             then I know 'em.
   
   Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
   continues.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             He killed a guy who works for him the
             other day.
   
                       JACKIE
             Beaumont Livingston?
   
                       MELANIE
             You already knew that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Kinda.
   
                       MELANIE
             So tell me. Having all that money in
             your flight bag - Is it tempting?
   
   Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to
             carry in ten thousand dollars, that
             would be the last motherfuckin' time
             he saw me. The next trip you're gonna
             have over half-a-million. If you
             thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure
             as hell wouldn't blame you.
   
   Jackie smiles.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             You think I'm kidding?
   
                       JACKIE
             Dreaming.
   
                       MELANIE
             You know how easy it would be? He
             won't be anywhere near that mall.
             Pull one more switch, up front.
             That's it. half-a-million dollars.
             Need help?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (smiling)
             Keep it between us girls?
   
                       MELANIE
             What's that fucker ever done for us?
   
                       JACKIE
                   (getting off the
                   barstool)
             I don't think so, but thanks for the
             beer.
   
   Jackie leaves.
   
   
   CLOSEUP MELANIE
   
   Watches her go.
   
                       MELANIE
                   (softly under her breath)
             Chicken shit.
   
   
   INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT
   
   Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak
   dinner. Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell has a white guy working for
             him named Louis.
   
                       NICOLET
             You two meet?
   
                       JACKIE
             This afternoon before I came here. He
             was with Ordell at an apartment in
             Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
             lives there, but I can find out.
   
                       NICOLET
             You talk to him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really.
   
                       NICOLET
             His full name is Louis Gara. He just
             got out from serving four years in
             Susanville.
   
                       JACKIE
             What for?
   
                       NICOLET
             Bank robbery? Do you know what he
             does for Ordell?
   
                       JACKIE
             I imagine shit needs to be done.
   
                       NICOLET
             We've been following Mr. Gara, and
             he's definitely working for Ordell.
   
                                               FLASH ON:
   
   
   NICOLET AND DARGUS
   
   In a car, parked, on surveillance.
   
   
   COPS POV
   
   Louis with the van, at the storage facility.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             They served two years together almost
             twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
             doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
             Ordell's got him staying at a house
             in.
   
   
   MUG SHOT SIMONE
   
   The older woman in the mall.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             ... Compton with a fifty-six-year-
             old petty thief - woman named Simone
             Hawkins.
   
   
   BACK TO BAR
   
                       NICOLET
             Ever meet her, or they talk about
             her?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not yet.
   
                       NICOLET
             Who's the other one?
   
                       JACKIE
             White girl named Melanie Ralston.
             Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
   
                       NICOLET
             What's her story?
   
                       JACKIE
             It was her coke I got busted with.
             She knows everything, but she's not
             part of it, and she's pissed cause
             she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
             even let her stay at the meeting. She
             tried to talk me into ripping off
             Ordell.
   
                       NICOLET
             And splittin' with her?
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sure that was the idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you say?
   
                       JACKIE
             I smiled and walked away. She also
             told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
   
                       NICOLET
             She told you that?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Was she there?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't say.
   
                       NICOLET
             But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
             like to have a word with. So
             everything's set for tomorrow?
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same, except
             one change...
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
   white wine.
   
   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
   
   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
   what she wants them to think.
   
   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
   an all-important competition.
   
                       JACKIE
             I told them Ordell's changed the
             amount he's bringing in.
   
                       MAX
             Do you think they bought it?
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
             Ordell's real nervous. They love
             thinking he's scared of them.
   
                       MAX
             You know, a good cop won't let you
             know he knows you're fulla shit.
   
                       JACKIE
             All he needed was a reasonable
             explanation.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET
   
   MEDIUM JACKIE
   
                       JACKIE
             Right. Everything's the same except
             one change. Ordell thinks it's just
             too hot right now to bring in all his
             money. He knows you're watching him,
             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
             stash where it is, but he wants to
             bring in fifty thousand for bail in
             case he needs it.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX
   
                       MAX
             It'll be more than that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
   
                       MAX
             But you still have to show him the
             money at the airport.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, you know I'm not going to show
             him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
             thousand.
   
                       MAX
             Where's the rest of it?
   
                       JACKIE
             In the bag underneath.
   
                       MAX
             What if he checks it?
   
                       JACKIE
             He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
             time. He'll be expecting fifty
             thousand and there it is - on top.
   
                       MAX
             You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
   
                       JACKIE
             Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
             Walker put the money in, and I didn't
             know nothing about it. Like the coke.
   
                       MAX
             Then you're out and you get nothing.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
             tried.
   
                       MAX
             You're gonna have surveillance all
             over you.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why you don't make a move till
             I come out of the fitting room.
   
                       MAX
             In a dress.
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, a suit. There's one I had my
             eye on.
   
   The phone rings.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Excuse me.
   
   
   INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone
   
                       ORDELL
             It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
             in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout
             - everything's the same - except for
             one change. That bitch you saw in the
             mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
             cause she split on me.
                   (pause)
             Me an Louis went over to her place
             ,she's gone. She's gone and all her
             shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
             dollars.
                   (pause)
             It ain't nothin' to worry about,
             girl. Everything's just like we
             discussed. Except when you do the
             switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
             be Melanie.
   
   Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
   Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
   watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.
   
   
   ON TV
   
   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
   pursued by police cars.
   
   They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
   gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
   So knock it of."
   
   Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.
   
   Louis turns back to the television.

   Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind
   it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black

   Rearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside
   takes up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the
   edges, covers the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts
   and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope
   with fifty thousand right on top.
   
   
   INT. CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY
   
   Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
   and is stopped by a PASSENGER.
   
                       PASSENGER
             Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
             and you spend half the fuckin' flight
             in the can. Soon as we land I'm
             making a formal complaint.
   
                       JACKIE
             Why, because I called you an asshole.
   
                       PASSENGER
             You didn't call me that.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't? Oh, well, you're an

   Jackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her
   bag on wheels behind her.
   
   Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.
   
                       NICOLET
             We have to stop meeting like this.
   
   They fall into step towards her car.
   
                       JACKIE
             You said that the last time.
   
                       NICOLET
             Well, it's true, isn't it? After his
             is buttoned up we could meet
             someplace else. What do you think?
   
                       JACKIE
             We could, if I'm not in jail.
   
                       NICOLET
             Oh, that's taken care of. I called
             the State Attorney's Office. You were
             no-filed this morning in Circuit

   This information stops Jackie in her tracks.

             Are you saying I'm off the hook?
   
   
   JACKIE'S POV
   
   Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
   at Jackie.
   
                       NICOLET
             Free as a bird. I still expect you to
             finish the job, though. How much do
             you have this time?
   
   Jackie starts walking again
   
                       JACKIE
             Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
             pretty sure he's gonna need it for
             bail.
   
   
   INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY
   
   Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
   bag in his lap.
   
   He unzips it.
   
   He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.
   
   Jackie watches all of this.
   
                       NICOLET
             That's fifty thousand, huh? It
             doesn't look like that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             I was told ten thousand in each pack.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't count it?
   
                       JACKIE
             I never have. It's not my money.
   
   He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
   the folds of a skirt.
   
                       NICOLET
             He might have slipped some coke in
             here. Did you check?
   
   Jackie, cool.
   
                       JACKIE
             Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
             that again.
   
   Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
   into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
   to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
   rubber-banded bond packets of loot.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Ever been tempted?
   
                       NICOLET
             What? To put one of these in my
             pocket?
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       NICOLET
             If I did, I'd have to give you one,
             wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
             want. No one knows how much there is
             except us, right?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes. All those things are true.
   
                       NICOLET
             After all, it don't belong to nobody,
             right?
   
                       JACKIE
             That would be one point of view.
   
                       NICOLET
             Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
             that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
             evidence, it belongs to us. You are
             now officially out of trouble. Don't
             do nothing stupid, now.
   
                       JACKIE
             How can I do anything if I'm being
             watched every second?
   
                       NICOLET
             I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
             the trouble of pointing it out to
             you.
                   (holding up the money)
             Put this in your shopping bag. It's
             what I expect to find when I look in
             Sheronda's. Comprende?
   
                       JACKIE
             Si.

                       LOUIS
             I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.
   
   Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
   retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, you the one in motherfuckin'
             charge.

             Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
   
                       ORDELL
             Go in there, snatch her by the hair,
             and drag her big ass out. This is my
             goddam money we're talking about. Get
             your ass out the door.
   
   He hangs up on Louis.
   
   Louis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like
   that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where
   it rightly belongs - Melanie.
   
   Louis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's
   playing.

   Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
   goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
   the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
   
   Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
   fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
   thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
   envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
   the rest of the bag with beach towels.
   
   Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
   carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
   confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
   the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
   around. Any one of them could be surveillance.
   
   She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
   Roinson's/May store.
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
   
   Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young

   clothing area.
   
   The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.
   
                       AMY
             Can I help you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
             on.
   
   Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
   sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.
   
                       JACKIE
             This looks pretty good on me.
   
                       AMY
             Are you kidding, it looks great. You
             wear this to a business meeting,
             you're the badass in the room. But
             you can go out dancing in this too.
             It's a total power suit.
   
   Jackie studies her reflection.
   
                       JACKIE
             I think I'm gonna just get this for
             today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
             you mind ringing this up while I
             change out of it?
   
                       AMY
             Not a problem.
   
                       JACKIE
             Thanks.
   
   Jackie walks into the fitting room.
   
   
   INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY
   
   She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
   cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
   
   She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
   her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
   
   A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
   looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
   next to her.
   
   Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.
   
                       MEALNIE (O.S.)
             Jackie?
   
                       JACKIE
             Hi, Melanie.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             Are you getting that black suit?
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, do you like it?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             It looks good on you.
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you got something for me?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
             You betcha.
   
   A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
   comes sliding underneath the stall.
   
   Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
   books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
   
   She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
   and lies it on top of the bag.
   
   As she does all this Melanie continues talking.
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             We coulda worked this. You know that,
             dontcha? You would've made out a lot
             better than you're going to, believe
             me.
   
   Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
   stall.
   
   Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.
   
                       JACKIE
             I put a little cherry on top. You're
             right. What the hell he ever do for
             us?
   
                       MELANIE (O.S.)
                   (quietly)
             Thanks.
   
                       JACKIE
             Now be careful with that bag. You
             don't want it ripping open on you in
             the middle of the store.
   
   We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
   
   Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
   of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
   sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
   
   Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
   She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
   Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.
   
   
   INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY
   
   Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
   frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
   counter where Amy waits for her.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
             the suit - get out of that damn
             uniform.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, that's not a problem.
   
   As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
   the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
   RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
   as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She leaves. We follow her...
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   ... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
   main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
   Jackie is completely gone.
   
   She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
   to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
   twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
   she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
   tears.
   
   As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
             took the money.
   
   The CAMERA stops twirling.
   
   Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
   running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
   a frantic Jackie yells;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Melanie burst in the dressing room
             and took the money!
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
   Melanie's Toyota.

   "TIME: 4:12"
   
   Louis is the first out of the car.
   
                       LOUIS
             Come on, goddammit, we're late!
   
   
   INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   We STEDICAM in front of them, Louis the rapid pacesetter,
   pulling Melanie behind him by the hand. Melanie carries
   the Robinson's/May switch bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             We shoulda been there already and we
             woulda been if it hadn't been for
             your fuckin' around!
   
   They go inside Robinson's/May...
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   ... We STEDICAM into Robison's/May with them. We lose
   them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
   but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
   in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
   floor.
   
                       AM
             ... You wear this to a business
             meeting, you're the badass in the
             room...
   
   We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
   watching Jackie.
   
                       MELANIE
             That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
             gonna go over and look at this Michi
             Moon display.
   
                       LOUIS
             Just stay right fuckin' here, all
             right?
   
                       MELANIE
             Are you sweating?
   
   Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
   dampness.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Job a little too much for you?
   
   Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
   
   Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
   a natural-born smart ass to change.
   
                       MELANIE
             I'll be over here. You're too
             conspicuous.
   
   Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
   inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
   him.
   
   He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
   time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
   
                       LOUIS
                   (under his breath)
             Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
   
   He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
   much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
   something that stops him cold.
   
   
   MAX CHERRY
   
   Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
   fitting room.
   
   He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
   
   Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
   staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
   Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
   to do what he was doing.
   
   He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
   any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
   Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
   register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
   there are doing customer stuff.
   
   Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
   and head down a different aisle.
   
   He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
   fight is said tense and low.
   
                       LOUIS
             What are you doin'?
   
                       MELANIE
             I'm getting out of here. What do you
             think?
   
                       LOUIS
             Lemme have the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Fuck you. I can carry it.
   
   She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
   and pulls her around.
   
                       LOUIS
             Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
   
                       MELANIE
             Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
             fuckin' bag?
   
                       LOUIS
             Gimme that bag before I knock you out
             and take it.
   
   Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
   that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
   the bag.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
             wrong with you?
   
   He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
   them.
   
                       LOUIS
             I'm carrying it.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
             pill, for christ sake.
   
   Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
   through gritted teeth;
   
                       LOUIS
             Fuck you with your chill pill.
   
   In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;
   
                       MELANIE
             Remember where we came in?
   
   Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
                   (like a teacher on Romper
                   Room)
             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
             in through Bullocks. I know where it
             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
   
   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
   smirk, follows behind.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
   
   Melanie follows close behind.
   
   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
   see he has a searching look on his face.
   
                       MELANIE
             You have no idea where you parked, do
             you?
   
   Louis doesn't answer.
   
   Melanie laughs.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Jesus, but if you two aren't the
             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
             life... How did you ever rob a bank?
             When you robbed banks, did you have
             to look for your car then too? No
             wonder you went to jail.
   
   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
   up.
   
   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
   
                       LOUIS
             Yeah, down the end.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   They walk it; it's not it.
   
   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
   next one.
   
                       MELANIE (CONT'D)
             Is it this aisle or the next one
             over?
   
                       LOUIS
             This one.
   
                       MELANIE
             You sure?
   
   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
             telling you, keep your mouth shut.
   
   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
   
                       LOUIS
             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
             word.
   
                       MELANIE
             Okay, Lou-is.
   
   That did it!
   
   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
   her... BAM... in the belly.
   
   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
   
   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
   
   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
   
   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
   HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
   
                       LOUIS
             See, just where I fuckin' said it
             was!
   
   He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
   
   We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
   cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
   and yells through the passenger window;
   
                       LOUIS
             Hey, look. I found it!
   
   He drives away.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
   in the parking lot.
   
   SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TIME: 4:04"
   
   Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
   Del Amo Mall.
   
   
   INT. ROBINSON'S/MAY - DAY
   
   Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
   Robinson's/May store.
   
   He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
   the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Can I show you something?
   
                       MAX
             Not right now. I'm just killing time
             waiting for my wife. But thanks,
             anyway.
   
                       SALESGIRL
             Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
             don't be shy.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks, I won't.
   
   She goes off.
   
   He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
   out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
   
                       AMY
             Oh, my God. You look so cool.
   
   Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
   
   Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
   his breath;
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
                   (low)
             And away we go.
   
   Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
   a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
   
   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
   Clothes.
   
   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
   on a rack.
   
   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
   
   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
   
   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
   
   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
   
   Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
   the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
   his before he can see a reaction.
   
   Max continues his fake browsing.
   
   He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
   Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
   
   She and Louis disappear.
   
   He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
   Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
   cash, then leaves stopping to say;
   
                       JACKIE
             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
             there. Looks like beach towels.
   
   She's gone.
   
   Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
   
   It's Max's turn.
   
   As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
   he says to himself;
   
                       MAX
             Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
             years dealing with people who take
             incredible risks. You walk over to
             that counter, you're gonna find out
             what it's like.
   
   Max takes a few moments...
   
   ... then walks over to Amy.
   
                       MAX
             Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
             left a bag of beach towels in the
             fitting room?
   
                       AMY
             Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
             get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
             think they're in the last stall.
   
                       MAX
             Thanks.
   
   Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
   the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
   
   He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
   towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
   Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
   
                       MAX
             Got 'em, thanks.
   
                       AMY
             Sure thing.
   
   Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
   parking lot.
   
   
   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY
   
   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
   
   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
   He made it. It worked.
   
   Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
   his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
   
   
   INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY
   
   Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
   and watching a stripper strip.
   
                       BARTENDER
             There a Ordell here?
   
                       ORDELL
             That's me.
   
   The bartender hands him the phone.
   
                       BARTENDER
             Don't talks all day.
   
   Ordell takes the receiver.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
   Ordell's tiny cellular.
   
                       LOUIS
             It's Louis.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (now into phone)
             Did you get it?
   
                       LOUIS
             I got it. Listen, there's something
             else I have to tell you.
   
                       ORDELL
             When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
             You count the money?
   
                       LOUIS
             I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
             still in the shopping bag.
   
                       ORDELL
             Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
                   (pause)
             Louis.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I got to talk to you
             about. You see, Melanie was giving me
             a hard time -
   
                       ORDELL
             - Not now, pick me up.
   
   Louis hears the phone disconnect.
   
   
   EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY
   
   The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
   in, the car takes off.
   
   
   INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY
   
   Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
   backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
   lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
             they got all them car dealerships.
             We're gonna leave this heap in a
             parking lot and get one the cops
             don't know about.
                   (pause)
             Hey, where's Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             That's what I gotta tell you. She
             bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
             with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
             carry the bag. Started running her
             fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
             right away when we came out where the
             car was parked, so she got on me
             about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
             is it that one?" She was totally
             fuckin' with my nerves.
   
                       ORDELL
             So what, you left her there.
   
                       LOUIS
             I shot her.
   
   Ordell just looks at him.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             I expect she's dead.
   
   Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot Melanie?
   
                       LOUIS
             Twice. In the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Couldn't talk to her?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know how she is.
   
                       ORDELL
             You couldn't just hit her?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe... but at that moment... I
             dunno...
   
                       ORDELL
             You shot her twice?
   
                       LOUIS
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             So you're sure she's dead.
   
                       LOUIS
             Pretty sure.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where did you shoot her?
   
                       LOUIS
             In the chest and stomach.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, if you had to do it, you had to
             do it. What we don't want is that
             bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
             that woman.
   
   Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
   pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
   top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
   looks inside the bag for the longest time.
   
   Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
                   (quiet)
             Louis?
   
                       LOUIS
                   (not looking at him)
             What?
   
                       ORDELL
             Where's the rest of it?
             
                       LOUIS
                   (looking at him)
             How much it there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
   
                       LOUIS
             You said five hundred and fifty!
   
                       ORDELL
                   (calm)
             So you light, ain't you. You light
             about a half-a-million.
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, that's the bag she came out
             with. She never even put her hand in
             it, and neither did I.
   
                       ORDELL
             Came outta where?
   
                       LOUIS
             The fitting room. It went down
             exactly the way it was supposed to.
   
                       ORDELL
             How long was she in there?
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe a minute. She came right out.
   
                       ORDELL
             Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
   
                       LOUIS
             Look, I swear to fucking god, she
             came out with that bag and I took it
             from her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then what?
   
                       LOUIS
             We went to the parking lot.
   
                       ORDELL
             Where you shot her.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's right.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure she ain't somewhere with a
             half-a-million dollars I worked my
             ass off to earn?
   
   Louis looks at Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (quietly)
             Fuck you for asking me that.
   
                       ORDELL
             Pull the car over.
   
   Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             What'd you shoot her with?
   
                       LOUIS
             It's in there.
   
   Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
   smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.
   
                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
             What's that gonna tell you" If I was
             really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
             two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
             trusted me.
   
   Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   He thinks.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
   saying with a smile;
   
                       JACKIE
             Gotcha, nigga.
   
                                               DISSOLVE BACK
                                               TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
   Beretta.
   
                       ORDELL
             Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
   
                       LOUIS
             If she's got it, why didn't she take
             it all?
   
                       ORDELL
             'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,
             I'll ask her.
   
                       LOUIS
             Maybe the Feds got it.
   
                       ORDELL
             If there were nothin; in here but
             towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
             to take it from her suitcase and
             A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
             fuckin' books in here to trick our
             ass.
   
                       LOUIS
             That's why I never checked it. The
             bag felt right.
   
                       ORDELL
             Then she throws forty thousand in
             here, to rub the shit in my face,
             know what I'm saying? She wants me to
             know she ripped me off.
   
                       LOUIS
             I don't know. Either she has it or
             the Feds.
   
                       ORDELL
             Or...
                   (pause)
             ... she gave it to somebody else
             first, before Melanie went in the
             dressing room.
   
   It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
   something.
   
                       LOUIS
             Jesus Christ.
   
                       ORDELL
             What?
   
                       LOUIS
             You know who I saw in the dress
             department?
   
                       ORDELL
             Tell me.
   
                       LOUIS
             I didn't really think anything of it.
             No - I did wonder what he was doing
             there, but didn't think it had
             anything to do with us. You know like
             maybe he was there with his wife or
             girlfriend.
   
                       ORDELL
             You gonna tell me who it was?
   
                       LOUIS
             Max Cherry.
   
   Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
   looks back.
   
                       ORDELL
             You see Max Cherry in the dress
             department. We're about to be handed
             half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
             me when I'm talking to you! And you
             don't think nothing of him being
             there!
   
                       LOUIS
             Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
             each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Hell, yes, they know each other. He
             bonded her out of county.
   
                       LOUIS
             How am I supposed to know that?
   
                       ORDELL
             You know the motherfucker's a bail
             bondsman, don't ya? You know every
             last one of them motherfuckers is
             crooked as hell?
   
                       LOUIS
             Why should I think anything's weird,
             if I don't know nothin' about them
             knowing each other?
   
                       ORDELL
             Man, I don't want to hear your
             fuckin' excuses!
   
   Louis gets mad.
   
                       LOUIS
             I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
             I'm givin' you reasons.
   
                       ORDELL
             Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
             lost all the goddam money I got in
             the world! Let me tell you the
             reason, motherfucker! The reason is,
             your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
   
   Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
   Ordell;
   
                       LOUIS
                   (hard)
             You best back off.
   
   We hear a BAM.
   
   Louis jerks.
   
   Ordell shot him.
   
   Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
   staring at Ordell.
   
   Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
   Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.
   
   This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
   He slumps over - his life gone.
   
   Ordell looks at him.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck happened to you, man?
             Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
   
   Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving
   Louis' dead body there.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   MEDIUM NICOLET
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't tell me you were gonna do
             some shopping.
   
   
   INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY
   
   Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
   chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
   of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
   coffee in he other.
   
   Ray stands.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought I did.
   
                       NICOLET
             You didn't. I would think with all
             this on your mind, you'd wait till
             after.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got there early. I've had my eye on
             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
             got there early. The idea was to try
             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
             did, get them to wrap it up, and
             change back into my uniform. That's
             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
             with fifty thousand, and go home.
   
                       NICOLET
             But you didn't do that.
   
                       JACKIE
             Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
             swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
             it.
                   (pause)
             And someone killed her for it.
   
   Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.
   
                       NICOLET
             Where's the bag she gave you?
   
                       JACKIE
             She didn't give me one. I told you
             before, Melanie wasn't part of the
             plan. Ordell must of told her to do
             it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
             bag, and takes off. What am I
             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
             my fucking underwear. I had to get
             dressed before I could do anything.
             So I put this back on 'cause could
             put this on faster than I could my
             uniform.
   
                       NICOLET
             You took the time to pay the
             saleswoman.
   
                       JACKIE
             I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
             know what to do.
   
                       NICOLET
             What did you do after that?
   
                       JACKIE
             I went looking for you. I went
             straight to the bookstore, 'cause
             that's where you were last time, but
             you weren't there. How the hell else
             am I supposed to let anybody know
             what happened? You didn't tell me how
             to do that, did you? I knew I was
             under surveillance, so when I
             couldn't spot anybody, I started
             yelling.
   
                       NICOLET
             There was a guy with Melanie?
   
                       JACKIE
             Not in the fitting room.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT
   
   Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.
   
                       NICOLET (V.O.)
             We had our agent on you. She sees a
             blonde come out of the fitting room
             carrying a Robinson's/May bag and
             tussle with a tough-looking white
             guy. The white guy takes the shopping
             bag and they go.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
                       NICOLET
             This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
             Gara?
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't see him. I was in my
             underwear. If it was a white guy, it
             was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
   
                       NICOLET
             It's possible. You're saying you
             don't have any idea what happened to
             that fifty thousand?
   
                       JACKIE
             I have no idea.
   
                       NICOLET
             You'd take a polygraph on it?
   
                       JACKIE
             If it'll make you happy.
   
                       NICOLET
             I sure hope you haven't done anything
             dumb Jackie.
   
   Dargus comes to the doorway...
   
                       DARGUS
                   (to Nicolet)
             Can I have a word with you?
   
                       NICOLET
             Sure.
   
   They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the
   room, smoking.
   
   They both come back in.
   
   Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner
   saying nothing.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
             dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
             lost Ordell.
   
                       JACKIE
             I thought you were watching him.
   
                       NICOLET
             We were, and we lost him. He walked
             into a strip bar sometime around
             three thirty and never came out. The
             bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
             and-a-half from where Louis was found
             dead. It looks like Louis's friend
             shot him twice at point blank range.
   
                       JACKIE
             So what happens now?
   
                       NICOLET
             We pick up Ordell. We've got three
             murders we can link him to. We have
             the storage unit where he keeps his
             guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
             warrant to go in and get him. And we
             have you.
   
                       JACKIE
             What about me?
   
                       NICOLET
             What about you?
   
                       JACKIE
             Do you think I took some of that
             money?
   
                       NICOLET
             I have no evidence of your taking
             anything. You didn't pay for your
             snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
             was glad to see that. You've been
             helping us out, you gave us Melanie
             and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
             marked bills stuffed in her shorts
             when they found her, which goes a
             long way backing up your story.
   
   Jackie listens.
   
                       NICOLET (CONT'D)
             I'll settle for Ordell with the
             marked bills.
   
                       NICOLET
             If you have something else going on
             you haven't told me about, it's
             between you and Ordell. All I gotta
             say is, you better hope we find him
             before he finds you.
   
                                               DISSOLVE TO:
   
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   On the phone.
   
                       ORDEL
             ... I can't leave here today... Mr.
             Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I
             get my money... You wouldn't have
             that fuckin' boat weren't for me.
             Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
             friends are... Mr. Walker?
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - DAY
   
   Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding
   on the couch named RAYNELLE. The filthy apartment we're
   in belongs to her.
   
                       ORDELL
             Can you believe that shit?
             Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
             nigger. Do things for people and
             that's how they treat you. Goddamn
             girl, how can you live like this?
   
   He dials another number.
   
                       RAYNELLE
                   (stoned)
             Like what?
   
                       ORDELL
             Girl, this shit is repugnant.
   
                       WINSTON (O.S.)
                   (on other end of phone)
             Cherry Bail Bonds.
   
                       ORDELL
             Let me speak to Max Cherry.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   Winston behind his desk, on the phone.
   
                       WINSTON
             He ain't here right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             He leave town?
   
                       WINSTON
             He's around.
   
                       ORDELL
             Give me his home number.
   
                       WINSTON
             I'll give you his beeper.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   A YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV
   
   Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
   stand-up routine.
   
   
   INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
   Jam; neither one is laughing. Raynelle's too stoned.
   Ordell's too tense. The phone rings, he jumps on it
   
                       ORDELL
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on
   the edge of the desk listening.
   
                       MAX
             I've been looking for you.
   
   Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know who this is?
   
                       MAX
             Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
             ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
             why you called.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             The bond collateral on Beaumont
             Livingston you moved over to cover
             Miss Brown, remember?
   
                       ORDELL
             She got off, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They decided to no-file. Tell me
             where you are and I'll bring you your
             money.
   
   Ordell doesn't say anything.
   
                       MAX (CONT'D)
             You still there?
   
                       ORDELL
             Looky here, I know you helped her and
             I know you know what I want Jackie
             can tell me any story come in that
             pretty head of hers. Long as at the
             end of that story, she hands over my
             money. She do that, we're still
             friends. Now, she don't wanna be my
             friend no more, tell her to think
             about ol' Louis. And if she tries to
             turn me in, I'll name her ass as my
             accessory. We'll go upstate together.
             Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that
             shit's a promise, understand what I'm
             sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll
             call you back.
   
   Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
   of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.
   
   Max looks at Winston.
   
                       MAX
             You're right, that was Ordell. You
             have time, you think you could find
             out for me where he's staying?
   
                       WINSTON
             Cops can't locate him, huh?
   
                       MAX
             They don't have your winning
             personality.
   
                       WINSTON
             Sure thing. I don't have to know what
             I'm doing, long as you know.
   
                       MAX
             I think I do. Is that good enough?
   
   
   EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
   
   A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
   rooms.
   
   
   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
   panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.
   
   She answers the phone.
   
                       JACKIE
             Hello.
   
   
   INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT
   
   Max on the phone in his office, alone.
   
                       MAX
             I know where he is.
   
   This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the
   TV set and zaps the sound.
   
                       JACKIE
             How'd you find out?
   
                       MAX
             All Winston had to do was ask around.
             Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
             woman junkie.
   
                       JACKIE
             How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
             and all the local Police can't?
   
                       MAX
             People talk to Winston. He's street,
             same as them, they trust him. They
             get busted, they know somebody who
             can bond them out. I thought I might
             drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
             surprised to see me.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's liable to shoot you.
   
                       MAX
             On the phone I told him I have the
             ten thousand he put up for your bond.
             I could bring the money and the
             papers for him to sign. Walk out and
             call the Sheriff's department.
   
   Jackie gets off the bed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Ray wants him.
   
                       MAX
             Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
             suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
             him in, he's gonna name you as an
             accessory.
   
   Jackie lights up a Davidoff.
   
                       JACKIE
             That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
             case. I'm their witness. They
             wouldn't have a case without me. If
             it's his word against mine, who are
             they gonna believe?
   
                       MAX
             It's not that simple.
   
   Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
   pacing back and forth.
   
                       JACKIE
             It never was, so I'm not gonna start
             worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
             or less believes my story, and he
             more or less doesn't care. All he
             really gives a shit about is getting
             Ordell.
   
                       MAX
             So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Get Ordell to come to your office.
   
                       MAX
             Set him up.
   
                       JACKIE
             Uh-huh.
   
                       MAX
             Tell him you want to see him?
   
                       JACKIE
             Tell him I want to give him his
             money.
   
                       MAX
             Why?
   
                       JACKIE
             I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
             him. He'll like that.
   
                       MAX
             What do you tell Nicolet?
   
                       JACKIE
             Ordell called and wants to meet me
             and I'm scared.
   
                       MAX
             We get Ordell to come to my office.
             Nicolet - is he already there, or
             does he come busting in while we're
             chatting?
   
   Jackie takes a drag.
   
                       JACKIE
             He's already there.
   
                       MAX
             What if he hears something he's not
             supposed to?
   
                       JACKIE
             Well, we don't let that happen, now
             do we?
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
   on the door.
   
   Ordell throws open the door.
   
                       ORDELL
             What the fuck you doin' knockin on
             the door like the goddamn police? You
             lookin' to get shot?
   
                       MAX
             I thought you might be asleep.
   
                       ORDELL
             You keep fuckin' with me, you're
             gonna be asleep forever.
   
   He looks past Max.
   
                       MAX
             I'm alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             Git your ass in here.
   
   Max enters, Ordell slams the door.
   
   As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
   his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better freeze, motherfucker!
   
   Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.
   
                       MAX
             You want your money? Your bond
             refund?
   
   He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
   wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
   catches it with his free hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's all?
   
                       MAX
             I have a bond receipt for you to
             sign.
   
                       ORDELL
             You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
             about. You talk to her?
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give you your money. If
             she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
             ramming the door right now.
   
                       ORDELL
             How'd you find me?
   
                       MAX
             Winston found you.
   
                       ORDELL
             How the fuck did he find me?
   
                       MAX
             That's what Winston does. He finds
             people who don't want to be found.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, bully for that nigga. You say
             she wants to give me the money, huh?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             Well, give it to me then.
   
                       MAX
             She wants to give it to you herself
             and collect her ten percent. She also
             wants to explain why she had to hold
             on to it.
   
                       ORDELL
             I'd like to hear that too. Turn
             around and put your hands on your
             head.
   
   Max does this, Ordell pats him down.
   
                       MAX
             Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
             already tried to get Jackie to go in
             with her, split the half million
             amongst themselves. What she did was
             take quite a risk to see you get your
             money.
   
                       ORDELL
             Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
   
                       MAX
             All I did was walk out with it.
   
                       ORDELL
             And you did that to protect my
             interest?
   
                       MAX
             In a way, yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
             dumbass. Go sit over there on the
             couch.
   
   Max does.
   
                       MAX
             This place stinks.
   
                       ORDELL
             You get used to it after a while. Now
             tell me where my money's at.
   
                       MAX
             My office.
   
                       ORDELL
             And where's Jackie?
   
                       MAX
             She's been there since Thursday
             night.
   
                       ORDELL
             She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
             home?
   
                       MAX
             She was afraid.
   
                       ORDELL
                   (laughs)
             That I gotta see.
   
                       MAX
             She still is. She doesn't want to get
             shot before she can tell you what
             happened.
   
                       ORDELL
             Have her bring the money here.
   
                       MAX
             It's in the safe. She can't get at
             it.
   
                       ORDELL
             Call her, tell her the combination.
   
                       MAX
             I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
             She won't leave there till you have
             your money and you're gone.
   
                       ORDELL
             You expect me to just walk in there?
   
                       MAX
             If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
             in custody right now. When you said
             you'd name her as an accessory she
             believed you. That scares her more
             than anything.
   
                       ORDELL
             That's why she's givin' up my money
             huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
             I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
             knew how to handle her. She was my
             blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
             fuckin' told Louis he could've just
             given her a punch in the mouth, he
             didn't need to shoot her. She's at
             your office.
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             By herself. That big mandingo nigga
             Winston ain't there, is he?
   
                       MAX
             She's all alone.
   
                       ORDELL
             I call your office, she better answer
             the phone.
   
                       MAX
             She will.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's
   desk.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.
   
   She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...
   
   
   INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a
   beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a
   dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV
   screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show
   ... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter-
   filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a
   sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair.
   The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
   offscreen.
   
   
   EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT
   
   They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.
   
                       ORDELL
             All the time I've known her, I never
             heard her sound scared like that.
             Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
             I'm driving, gimme the keys.
   
   Max hands him the keys. They climb in.
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
   her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.
   
   
   INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT
   
   Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
   the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
   the lights. The office goes dark. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
   slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
   sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
   Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
   illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
   drag. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL
   
   CLOSEUP ORDELL
   
   His face is ice, the music is LOUD.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   CLOSEUP JACKIE
   
   She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;
   
                       MAX
             It's the next street.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where it is.
   
                       MAX
             Turn left.
   
                       ORDELL
             I know where to turn.
   
   
   BACK TO JACKIE
   
   Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
   window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
   sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.
   
   
   BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX
   
   Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
   off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.
   
                       ORDELL
             My money's in that office, right?
   
                       MAX
             Uh-huh.
   
                       ORDELL
             She starts givin' me some bullshit
             about it ain't there. It's somewhere
             else and we can go get it.
                   (he holds up his Beretta)
             I'm shootin' you in the head right
             then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
             her in the kneecap, find out where my
             godamn money is. I go walkin' in
             there and that nigga Winston or
             anybody else is in there, you're the
             first man shot, understand what I'm
             sayin'?
   
                       MAX
             Yeah.
   
                       ORDELL
             Now, is there anything you want to
             tell me before we get out of this
             car?
   
                       MAX
             No.
   
                       ORDELL
             You sure?
   
                       MAX
             Yes.
   
                       ORDELL
             You better be, motherfucker.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT
   
   They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
   in his pants.
   
                       ORDELL
             Get ahead of me and open the door.
   
   Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
   opens the door.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Step inside easy.
   
   Max does.
   
   Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
   
   Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
   
                       ORDELL (CONT'D)
             Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
             in the goddamn dark for?
   
   Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
   bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
   light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
   out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
   
   Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
   Then Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE
             Mark...
                   (raising her voice)
             ... he's got a gun!
   
   Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
   Beretta in his pants...
   
   ... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
   times in the chest...
   
   ... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
   lands at Max's feet.
   
   Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
   of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
   
   Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
   Ordell's body.
   
   Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
   looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
   over to the body.
   
   Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
   holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
   out of the bathroom.
   
                       DARGUS
             He's dead.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS (CONT'D)
             Does he have the marked bills on him?
   
   Max still shaken;
   
                       MAX
             In his inside coat pocket.
   
   Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
   the forty-thousand marked dollars.
   
   Max looks at Jackie.
   
   She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
   just light up another Davidoff.
   
   Dargus looks up at Max;
   
                       DARGUS
             Why were you with him?
   
                       MAX
             I went to give him his refund, so he
             wouldn't have to come here.
   
                       DARGUS
             How'd you know where he was?
   
                       MAX
             I found out.
   
                       DARGUS
             And you didn't tell the Police?
   
                       MAX
             I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
             wanted him.
   
   Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.
   
                       JACKIE
             Remember when Ray said you hoped
             you'd get him before he got me?
   
   Dargus looks up and nods his head.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Well, you did. Thank you.
   
   She takes a drag on her Davidoff.
   
                                               FADE TO BLACK
   
   
   INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
   morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.
   
   A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:
   
   "TEN DAYS LATER"
   
   Max hears someone go;
   
                       JACKIE (O.S.)
             Knock knock.
   
   Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
   doorway. She smiles at him.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Hey.
   
   MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Mark... he's got a gun!
   
   Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.
   
   
   BACK TO OFFICE
   
   Max smiles back.
   
                       MAX
             Hey, you.
   
   Jackie walks toward him.
   
                       JACKIE
             I got your package. It was fun
             getting a half-a-million dollars in
             the mail.
   
                       MAX
             Less ten percent.
   
                       JACKIE
             Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
             out, since there wasn't no note.
   
   She sits in the chair in front of his desk.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I hesitated taking that much.
   
                       JACKIE
             You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
             you want.
   
                       MAX
             I'm sure.
   
   Pause between them.
   
                       JACKIE
             I'm leaving, I have my things in my
             car. Why don't you walk out with me?
             I want to show you something.
   
   Max hesitates.
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.
   
   He smiles and gets up from the desk.
   
   As she stands, Jackie says;
   
                       JACKIE (CONT'D)
             I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
             pissed he missed all the excitement.
   
                       MAX
             What's he doing?
   
                       JACKIE
             He's on to a new thing. He's after a
             guy who owns a gun shop he says is
             "woefully and wantonly" selling
             assault rifles to minors. He says
             he's gonna take him down if it's the
             last thing he does.
   
                       MAX
             Did you tell him you were leaving?
   
                       JACKIE
             I told him I might.
   
   
   EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY
   
   They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
   convertible.
   
                       MAX
             That's Ordell's.
   
                       JACKIE
             They've confiscated all his other
             stuff. But this one's sorta left
             over. The registration's in the glove
             box, the keys were under the seat...
             What's a matter" haven't you ever
             borrowed someone's car?
   
                       MAX
             Not after they're dead.
   
   She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
   at him across the black Mercedes.
   
                       JACKIE
             I didn't use you, Max.
   
                       MAX
             I didn't say you did.
   
                       JACKIE
             I never lied to you.
   
                       MAX
             I know.
   
                       JACKIE
             We're partners.
   
                       MAX
             I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't

             Do you blame yourself for helping me?
   
   He shakes his head 'no.'

             'd feel a whole lot better if you

             Sure I can't twist your arm?
   
                       MAX
             Thank you for saying that, but no. My

                       JACKIE
             I thought you were tired of your

                       JACKIE
             Are you scared of me?
   
   Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.
   
                       MAX
             A little bit.
   
   Jackie smiles back.
   
                       JACKIE
             Come over here.
   
   Max does.
   
   They give each other a long, tender kiss.
   
   She breaks it.

</b>          Do you find me sadistic?

<b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b>
BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he
<b>
</b>corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



<b>                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          I bet I could fry an egg on your
          head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



<b>                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
          now, you're aware enough to know
          there isn't a trace of sadism in
          my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
          these other jokers - bot not your.

<b>OVERHEAD SHOT
</b>We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



<b>                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
          at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

B/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

</b>          That's my best friend from work
          Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          That's the minister. I think his
          name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)

</b>


<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The
<b>
</b>          name on his driver's license was
          Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
          some reason he preferred Arthur.
          Maybe if he went by Carles people
          would have called him Charlie. If
          that was his reason for going by
          Arthur I can understand it.
          Nothing wrong with the name
          Charlie, except he didn't look like
          a Charlie, he looked like an
          Arthur.
          Obviously you'll have to take my
          word on this. Speaking of names, I
          was about two seconds away from
          becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
          Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



<b>INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
</b>
The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
          wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
          trying, I can tell you that.
          Actually Bill's last bullet put me
          in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
          for five years.
          When I woke up, ...I went on what
          the movie advertisements refer to
          as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
          roarded and I rampaged and I got
          bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
          killed 33 people to get to this
          piont right now.
          I have only one more.
          The last one.

          The only one left.
          And when I arrive at my

          .... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


<b>TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

<b>WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
</b>CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

</b>

We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY
</b><b>
</b>The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

<b>FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
</b>(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



<b>INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY
</b>
The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.
<b>
</b>The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



<b>                       FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
</b>             Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



<b>                       THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>             Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



<b>                        LITTLE GIRL
</b>             Mommy, what happened to you and the
             T.V. Room?
<b>
</b><b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Oh, that good for nothin dog of
          yours, got his little ass in the
          living room and acted a damn fool,
          that's what happened.



<b>                    LITTLE GIRL
</b>          Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



<b>                    THE    HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Now baby, you    can't come in here,
          there's broken    glass all over the
          floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



<b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          This is a old friend of mommy's I
          ain't seen in a long time.



<b>                     THE BRIDE

          your name?

* Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know. *

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



<b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Her name is Nikki.



<b>                     THE BRIDE
</b>          Nikki. What a pretty name for such
          a pretty little girl. How old are
          you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.
<b>
</b><b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Nikki, *(BLEEP)* aked you a

          I'm four.



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>          Four years    old, aye. You know I
          once had a    little girl. She'd be
          five right    now. Maybe you two could

<b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE

          grown-up talk to talk about, so you
          go in your room now and leave us
          alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



<b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>              (snapping her fingers)
          Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



<b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Want some coffee?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.
<b>
</b><b>                    THE HOUSEWIFE
</b>          Cream and sugar?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
<b>VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:
</b>


<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          This Pasadena homemaker's name is
          Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
          Lawrence Bell. But back when we
          were acquainted, five years ago,
          her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
          code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
          was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Were you expecting me?



<b>                    VERNITA

          then again a little later after
          your episode in Japan.
              (pause)
          So I suppose it's a little late for
          a apology, huh?



<b>                    THE BRIDE

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

          you're gonna start anymore shit
          around my baby girl!



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You can relax for now. I'm not
          going to murder you in front of
          your daughter.



<b>                    VERNITA
</b>          That's being more rational than
          Bill led me to believe you were
          capable of.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Well that's a demonstration of
          Bill's complete ignorance when it
          comes to the subject of me, and
          what I'm thinking, and what I might
          do. It's mercy, compassion, and
          forgiveness I lack, not
          rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.

          for long. I'll allow you to choose
          a time and place for us to meet
          again, preferably as far away from
          Nikki as possible.
          I could have just HIT you, I
          didn't, I demand respect for that.
          Since this is not a HIT, consider
          it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
          Vipers, we will observe Viper rules

well).

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.

          our little league has its games,
          about a mile from here. We meet
          there around two-thirty in the

          have us a knife fight, we won't be
<b>
</b>          bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
          cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Bill said you were one of the best
          ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
          weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



<b>                    VERNITA
</b>          Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't

              (snorts to herself)
          Black Mamba, I shoulda been
          motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Weapon of choice? And if you want
          to stick with your butcher knife,
          I'm cool with that.



<b>                    VERNITA
</b>          Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
<b>SMITHEREENS.
</b>
The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.
<b>
</b>While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



<b>                       VERNITA
</b>             Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
             don't...

             to mine...
                 (she takes her hand)
             ...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>             It was not my intention to do this
             in front of you. For that I'm
             sorry. But you can take my word for
             it, your mother had it coming. When
             you grow up, if you still feel raw
             about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



<b>EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY
</b>
The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.
<b>
</b>She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


<b>                        DEATH LIST FIVE
</b>
On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

          A great teacher taught me that
          once, he looked a whole lot like
<b>
</b>          you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          I guess.
              (pause)
          No, I don't need to guess, I know.
              (pause)
          Affirmative.
              (pause)
          I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Thought that was pretty funny
          didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
          don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Ya know now I get a better look at
          you, you're not so damn pretty.
          Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
          for you but...ya know, now I get a
          closer look at you you're kinda
          weird looking. You got this big
          nose that doesn't fit with the rest
          of your face, your eyes are two
          different sizes. And look at your
          skin...My complexion is way better
          than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...
<b>
</b>...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          If you ever take your ass out of
          this Goddamn bed for as long as you
          fuckin live, I will beat you into
          the ground, bitch!



<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Elle Driver in her nurse's uniform, angrily walks down the
hallway. She passes by a DOCTOR, STRUGGLING WITH A PATIENT
BLEEDING PROFUSELY on a gurney.



<b>                    DOCTOR

<b>INT. THE COMATOSE BRIDE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The CAMERA is in a corner of the ceiling, looking down on the
comatose Bride, who lies motionless in her bed.

WE HEAR the sound of a BUZZING MOSQUITO, doing loop de loops
and figure eights in the air, looking for some warm blood.

The BUZZING stops....

the last five years,

The BRIDE SITS BOLD UPRIGHT IN BED.

<b>QUICK CUT TO A FLASHBACK SPAGHETTI-WESTERN STYLE

<b>THE BARREL EXPLODES LEAT AT US - BANG!
</b>
QUICK CUT BACK TO The BRIDE IN HER HOSPITAL BED,
BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



<b>                      THE BRIDE
</b>          My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the
lines.

MACRO CU The LINES IN HER PALM look like a road map.

She stops counting, shocked;

The Bride's two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby
is long gone.

She hears the STEP...STEP...STEP...OF BILL'S BOOTS WALKING

</b>

walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel.



<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (THE BRIDE'S FLOOR) - NIGHT
</b>
We see a HOSPITAL ORDERLY'S bright red and white Reeboks
softly slapping against the smooth surface of the
institution's floor. They make a sound nothing like Bill's
shoes.

                                       two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
<b>VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;
</b>

<b>       BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY

<b>                      SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
</b>                   STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.
<b>
</b>She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
<b>BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.
</b>
The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



<b>                    THE ORDERLY
</b>          Now is that the cutest little
          blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
          that the cutest little blonde
          pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren)
fronts.



<b>                    WARREN
</b>          I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



<b>                    THE ORDERLY
</b>          Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
          know damn well this is the best
          pussy you ever saw you had touchin
          rights to. The price is seventy
          five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
          gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



<b>                    THE ORDERLY
</b>          Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
          no punchin 'er.
          Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
          'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
          jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
          under no circumstances.    And by the
<b>
</b>          way, this little cunt's a spitter -
          it's a motor reflex thing but spit
          or no, no punchin. Now are we
          absolutely positively clear about
          rule number one?



<b>                    TWO TRUCKERS
</b>          Yeah.



<b>                    THE ORDERLY
</b>          Rule number two;
          No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
          fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
          But after that, it's allll goooood.
          Her plummin down there don't work
          no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
          all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
          try not to make a mess, and I'll be
          back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



<b>                     THE ORDERLY
</b>          Oh by the way, not all the time,
          but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
          get drier than a bucket of sand.
          If she dry, lube up with this and
          you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
          gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
<b>BLINKS.
</b>


<b>                    GERALD
</b>          Hey Warren, she just blinked.



<b>                    WARREN
</b>          He said she can't blink.



<b>                    GERALD
</b>          I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



<b>                    WARREN
</b>          Just wait, when I get through with
          this little dumbbell, she gonna
          stand up and recite the Gettysburg
          Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



<b>                    WARREN
</b>          Hey, Gerald.



<b>                    GERALD

<b>                    WARREN

          know when it's your turn.



<b>                    GERALD

<b>                    WARREN

<b>                    GERALD
</b>          Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



<b>INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT
</b>
Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

<b>THEN...
</b>
He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;
<b>
</b><b>                    GERALD
</b>          He man, keep it down in there, I
          can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

<b>THEN...
</b>
The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



<b>INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
<b>CRASH BELOW FRAME.
</b>
The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
<b>STEP...STEP...STEP...
</b>
She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.
<b>
</b>The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



<b>                       ORDERLY
</b>          Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

<b>IMPACT CUT
</b>The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

<b>                                 SLAM!

</b>
<b>SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
</b><b>FRAME.
</b>
The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Where's Bill?



<b>                       THE ORDERLY

          Who?

<b>                                 SLAM!
</b>
He screams.
<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE

<b>                    THE ORDERLY

<b>                           SLAM!

<b>                    THE BRIDE

          or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

<b>                           SLAM!
</b>


<b>                    THE ORDERLY

<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Where is Bill?

<b>                           SLAM!
</b>
Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Where did you get this from?



<b>                    THE ORDERLY

<b>                    THE BRIDE

          this room ten minutes ago.

<b>                           SLAM!
</b>
Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of
<b>
</b>his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
<b>REMEMBERING THEME).
</b>
<b>WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
</b>We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



<b>                       BUCK
</b>             Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
             pie they all said you wuz. Well
             Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
             name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>             Your name's Buck, right? And you
             came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



<b>INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.
<b>
</b>She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

<b>INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

<b>POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
</b>The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and

ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.
<b>
</b>She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.

American tourist.

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Saying with surprise and admiration;

          words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>          No kidding, I heard it's kinda
          hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
</b>          What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>          I always heard it was difficult.



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
</b>          Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
          you have Japanese tongue.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>          Maybe I was Japanese in another

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;
<b>
</b><b>                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
</b>             Most definitely, most definitely
             Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



<b>                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

</b>             Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



<b>                       THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.

             Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
</b>          What brings you to Okinawa?



<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



<b>                       SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
</b>          What do you want with Hattori
          Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          I need Japanese steel.



<b>                    SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)

<b>INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY
</b>
The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.
<b>
</b>The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



<b>                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
</b>          Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



<b>                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
</b>          ...try the second one down in the
          sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



<b>                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
</b>          Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



<b>                    HANZO (ENGLISH)
</b>          ...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

<b>QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.
</b>
The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.
<b>
</b><b>                    HANZO (JAPANESE)

          so much must surely know, I no

          keep these here for their ascetic
          and sentimental value.
              (he takes both sword and
               sheath from her...)
          Yet proud tho I am of my life's

          me.

          the student, I'd say you had a
          rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...
<b>

.....before his head disappears, he says;



<b>                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
</b>          ...I suggest you spend it
          practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

            it's easy to lose your way...to get
            lost...
            to forget where you came in. To

            be found in the secret doctrine of

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



<b>                     BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
</b>           I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
           perversion done to this council,
           which I love more than my own
           children,...by making a half
           Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Drop them on the ground.

They do.



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Get behind me.
<b>
</b>They do.



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Get on your knees.

They do.



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



<b>                     O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>           Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



<b>                     O-REN

           time to time and always in a

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.

          Meeting adjourned.



<b>EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT
</b>
The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



<b>INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT
</b>
The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

<b>FLASH ON
</b>EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

<b>FLASH ON
</b><b>EX CU OF AN EYEBALL
</b>
The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

<b>FLASH ON
</b>EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.
<b>
</b>And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          The mop tops in black suits and
          Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
          "The Crazy 88." The two young girls
          in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
          personal bodyguards, the Yubari
          sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
          Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
          who's dressed like she's a villain
          on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
          and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
          finally, the American in the black
          suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
          head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

<b>INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.
</b>
O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



<b>INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.
<b>
</b><b>ONE SHOT
</b>
CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

<b>                                                 END OF SHOT
</b><b>BACK AND FORTH
</b>between CU's of the two women, face to face.



<b>                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
</b>               (to Bride)
           Can I help you?



<b>                     THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>           Yes, I am looking for the attorney
           of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
           that be you?



<b>                     SOFIE (JAPANESE)
</b>           I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
           can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



<b>INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM
</b>
Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale
<b>
</b>of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

<b>WHEN...
</b>
A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
</b>          O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
          unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

<b>O-REN'S
</b>reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
<b>BLEEPED OUT.
</b>
The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

<b>SOFIE
</b>Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

<b>MR. BARREL AND GO GO
</b>take positions on either side of O-Ren.

<b>O-REN
</b>seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b><b>
</b>          You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


                          The Bride
                             vs.
                         The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>          Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
          we're going to have to close the
          place. There's some private
          business that we must attend to
          now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



<b>                    O-REN
</b>          Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



<b>                    MIKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.
<b>
</b>Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

<b>OVERHEAD SHOT
</b>Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>          Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.
<b>
</b>The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
<b>SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
</b><b>SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
</b><b>COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.
</b>
The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

<b>...BEAT
</b>
...they Look back up at O-Ren.

<b>O-REN
</b>standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

<b>WHEN...
</b>
We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

<b>O-REN
</b>smiles.



<b>                     O   -REN (ENGLISH)
</b>              (to the     Bride)
          You didn't     think it was going to be
          that easy,     did you?
<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>              (to O-Ren)
          You know, for a second there, yeah
          I did.

O-Ren smiles...



<b>                    O-REN (ENGLISH)
</b>          Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



<b>                    O-REN/THE BRIDE
</b>          ...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
<b>ON SCREEN.
</b>
As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
<b>OIL BLACK.
</b><b>
</b>Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to
<b>
</b>collide.....They meet.....

<b>SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
</b><b>CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -
</b>
They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

<b>O-REN
</b>WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.
<b>
</b>The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
<b>OVER HER FACE.
</b>
Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

<b>WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
</b>With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

<b>GO GO
</b>Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b><b>
</b>          Those    of you lucky enough to still
          have    your lives. Take them with
          you.    But leave the limbs you've
          lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

<b>BALL AND CHAIN
</b>in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

<b>GO GO
</b>smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

<b>BAM
</b>
The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.
<b>
</b>Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
<b>HEAD.
</b>
The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.
<b>
</b>Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

<b>CU GO GO
</b>We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Mr. Barrel says;

          iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



<b>                    MR. BARREL

<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.
<b>
</b>Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



<b>                      THE BRIDE
</b>            I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



<b>                      MR. BARREL
</b>            The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



<b>                      MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
</b>            I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



<b>                      MR. BARREL
</b>            About that one you owe me.

<b>                      THE BRIDE

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;
<b>
</b><b>                    MR. BARREL
</b>          Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)
</b>          As last looks go, you could do
          worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



<b>INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT
</b>
As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

<b>O-REN'S FEET
</b>White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

</b>The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

<b>O-REN
</b>when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
<b>CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...
</b>
O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



<b>                    O-REN (ENGLISH)

          blade. Now unless you intend to
          commit sepeku among the koi, stand
          up and fight. You may not be able
          to fight like a samurai, but you
          can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with
<b>
</b>The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



<b>                    O-REN (JAPANESE)

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...
<b>
</b><b>UNTIL...
</b>
They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

<b>CU O-REN ISHII
</b>facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.

ended with one swing, stares off into space.



<b>                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

<b>                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



<b>                     O-REN (ENGLISH)

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

<b>EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.

<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          I know you feel you must avenge
          your sister. But I beg you...walk
          away.

Yuki giggles.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          You call that begging? You can beg
          better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



<b>                    YUKI    (JAPANESE)
</b>          Can I see your    face? I've heard
          your beauty is    exquisite. I would
          like to see for    myself.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>          Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
          is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



<b>                    THE BRIDE

</b>          Your face is so    pretty, I just want
          to put both of    my palms against
          your cheeks and    give you little
          tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          How do I look?



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b><b>
</b>          Very pretty.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          You're just saying that 'cause I
          told you how pretty you are.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          Yuki, you're gorgeous.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          Really? Is that how you'd describe
          me to somebody if I wasn't here?
          Yuki's gorgeous?



<b>                     THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>          You bet.

Yuki giggles.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          Don't make me kill you.



<b>                     YUKI (ENGLISH)
</b>          Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.
<b>
</b>Yuki yells to her in English;



<b>                    YUKI (ENGLISH)
</b>          You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
<b>HER.
</b>
She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

<b>WHEN...
</b>
Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

<b>SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...
</b>
<b>SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...
</b>
BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.
<b>
</b>The Bride yells at them;



<b>                     THE BRIDE
</b>          Stay in your house and stay down on
          the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          Time for the rabbit to come out of
          her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

<b>WHEN...
</b>
Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.
<b>
</b>The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>              (to herself)
          Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          You fucking bitch! You shot me in
          my breast! They're not fully
          developed yet, you fucking asshole!
          Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



<b>                    THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
</b>          Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
          going to be an army    of police here.
          So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
          the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
</b>          So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



<b>                    YUKI (JAPANESE)
</b>          That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the
<b>
</b>Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...
<b>
</b>The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

<b>...TILL...
</b>
...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.

<b>INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT
</b>
The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



<b>                       NURSE OWENS
</b>             Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



<b>                       THE BRIDE

<b>          THE BRIDE

</b>I'm dying.



<b>          NURSE OWENS
</b>Then bitch, you better call

<b>          THE BRIDE
</b>I can't call an ambulance.



<b>             NURSE OWENS
</b>--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



<b>          THE BRIDE
</b>I do have a choice, and I'm

<b>
</b>Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



<b>                    NURSE OWENS
</b>          Okay, where you at?



<b>                    THE BRIDE

          called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
          Avenue. There's a bunch of police

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



<b>INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Glad you made it.

          things like Negroes sneaking around
          people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          What's that?

<b>INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

<b>OVERHEAD SHOT
</b>The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



<b>                    THE BRIDE

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;

</b>          Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the

</b>          Open the door Alburt, let's see
          what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a
<b>
</b>tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



<b>                       L.F. O'BOYLE

L.F. laughs.



<b>                       L.F.
</b>             Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



<b>                       L.F.

             We now return to the game already
             in progress. The point is nine
             gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



<b>                       ALBURT
</b>             I'll take that.

</b>          Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
          dollar membership fee.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          That's rather pricey.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          I think I'll stay here. I'm
          thirsty.



<b>                      ALBURT

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



<b>                      BILL
</b>          Beer.

          Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



<b>                    BILL
</b>              (pointing to the can)
          I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.

them and inspects them.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.
<b>
</b>In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;

a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't

people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



<b>          L.F.
</b>You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red

will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



<b>                    L.F.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.

From the door Alburt says;



<b>                    ALBURT
</b>          You can't do that.



<b>                    BILL

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



<b>                    BILL

<b>INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.

          What about her family?
              (pause)
          Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone

          Okay that did it, we're going to
          Texas and talk sense into Budd
          before (BLEEP) makes him number
          three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



<b>                    BILL

          at the moment.
              (pause...he laughs)
          I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Got a nose problem?



<b>                    L.F.
</b>          I said you could use my phone. I
          didn't say I wouldn't listen.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          This is true.



<b>                    L.F.

<b>                     BILL
</b>          Course not. First rule of any
          house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
          comes in and wipes the place out
          insurance.



<b>                     L.F.
</b>          If there weren't losers it wouldn't
          be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;
<b>
</b><b>                       THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>             What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
             the real game was just beginning.
             Bill was on the job, and she was
             the target. Now Bill was the
             greatest assassin of the 20th
             century. In fact the term HITMAN
             was coined for him. And he rarely
             performs actual assassinations
             anymore. However every once in
             awhile - to keep his hand in - he
             does. Only he plays a game. He
             doesn't start big trouble...he lets
             them start it. If they do, they're
             dead. If they don't, not only won't
             he perform, he'll take the hit off
             the market. It's kind of fun
             watching people gamble when they
             don't know they're gambling, isn't
             it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



<b>                       L.F.
</b>             Get my money back. Don't kill him.
             Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



<b>INT. HALLWAY HOTEL
</b>
The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



<b>INT. HOTEL ROOM
</b>
L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.
<b>
</b>She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

<b>WHEN...
</b>
The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



<b>EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT
</b>
Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

<b>............... SHE FALLS....
</b>
<b>...................................SHE SPLATS.
</b>
Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

<b>EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY
</b>
A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;
<b>
</b>                           "The city of
                          Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Great day in the morning. Brother
          Bill livin up to his familia

<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
          mad rush of wild parties and
          wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
          Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          It's Elle. Want to say hello?



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Never said "bye," can't seem to
          think of a reason to say, "hi."

<b>INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

</b>Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between

<b>                    BUDD
</b>          It stinks in there, that's why. Now
          what's so important it requires a
          reunion?

<b>                                                TIME CUT
</b>
The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          You tryin to tell me she cut her
          way through eighty-eight bodyguards
          'fore she got to O-Ren?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          No. There wasn't really eighty
          eight of them, they just called
          themselves The Crazy 88.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Why.



<b>                    BILL
</b><b>
</b>          I dunno, I guess they thought it
          sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
          26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
          attacked. They all fell under her
          Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



<b>                    BILL
</b>          She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          He made her one? Didn't he swear a
          blood oath never to make another
          sword?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Them Japs know how to carry a
          grudge don't they? Or is it just
          you tend to bring that out in
          people?



<b>                    BILL
</b>              (pause)
          I know this is a ridiculous
          question before I ask, but you by
          any chance haven't kept up with
          your swordplay?



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Hell, I pawned that years ago.



<b>                    BILL

<b>
</b><b>                    BUDD

The disrespect is pain.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          It was priceless.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
          I got me 250 Dollars for it.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Since it was a gift from me, why
          didn't you offer me the chance to
          buy it back?



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Because that would've required me
          to acknowledge your existence.
          Drunken bum though I may be, I
          don't need booze that bad. But who
          the hell gives a crap anyway. That
          bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
          points for killin a white trash
          piece of shit like me with a
          samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
          titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
          fight me, all she gotta do is come
          down to the Club, start some shit,
          and we'll be in a a fight.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          -- Budd, you need to listen to me.
          I know we haven't spoken for quite
          some time, and the last time we
          spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
          you need to get over being mad at
          me, and start becoming afraid of
          Bea. Because she is coming, and
          she's coming to kill you. And
          unless you accept my assistance, I
          have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.
<b>
</b><b>                       BILL
</b>             Can't we forget the past, and look
             at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



<b>                       BUDD
</b>             And what would that happy side be?



<b>                       BILL
</b>             She's brought "the boys" back
             together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



<b>                       BUDD
</b>             I appreciate the concern on your
             face, but there's a difference
             'tween "the boys", time can't
             erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
             don't Jew outta payin my
             comeuppance. That woman deserves
             her revenge. And we deserve to die.
             But then again, so does she. So I
             guess we'll just see now, won't we.



<b>EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY
</b>
The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



<b>INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY
</b>
Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



<b>                       TED
</b>             You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
             school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,
<b>
</b>passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



<b>                       STRIPPER
</b>          Hey, Budd.



<b>                    BUDD

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



<b>                    STRIPPER
</b>          Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
          it again. There's shitty water all
          over the floor.

<b>EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



<b>INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>          Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....
<b>
</b>...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

<b>WHEN...
</b>
Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



<b>EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</b>
As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



<b>EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT
</b>
Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai
<b>
</b>sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

<b>THEN...
</b>
...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

<b>THEN...
</b>
Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

<b>THEN...
</b>
On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

<b>THEN...
</b>
Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on
<b>
</b>a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

<b>SERGIO LEONE CU:
</b>The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

<b>BUDD'S POV:
</b>The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



<b>                     BUDD
</b>           Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
           like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



<b>                     BUDD
</b><b>
</b>          You done got a double dose of rock
          salt, right in the ole tit.
          Now not havin tits as fine or as
          big as yours, I can't even imagine
          how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          ...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Now I know when it    comes to a rock
          salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
          much like a expert    bout now. But
          truth be told, you    ain't felt all
          rock salt's got to    offer till you
          took a double dose    in your
          backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          That gentled ya down, didn't it?
          Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
          two barrels of rock salt dug deep
          in their backyard.

<b>THEN...
</b>
Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

<b>THEN...
</b>
Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed
<b>
</b>of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

<b>THEN...
</b>
She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

<b>THEN...
</b>
We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

<b>TILL...
</b>
With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of
<b>
</b>"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
<b>"PAULA SCHULTZ."
</b>
Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



<b>                    BUDD (SPANISH)
</b>          Look at those eyes. This bitch is
          furious. You grab her feet, I'll
          get her head.
<b>              (ENGLISH)
</b>          Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



<b>                    BUDD (SPANISH)
</b>          In America white women call this
          the silent treatment.
              (laughing)
          And we let 'em think, we don't like
          it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
          this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Looky here bitch, this is a can of
          mace. Now you're goin underground
          tonight, and that's all there is to
          it. But, when I bury ya, I was
          gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.
<b>
</b><b>                       BUDD
</b>          But if    you're gonna act like    a
          horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
          Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
          you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
          alive.    So what's it gonna be
          sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          You may be stupid, but at least you
          ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

<b>WHEN...
</b>
...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

<b>THEN...
</b>
...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

<b>THEN...
</b>
...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



<b>INT. PINE BOX
</b>
Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

<b>TILL...
</b>
...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



<b>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
</b>
The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.
<b>
</b>Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



<b>INT. PINE BOX
</b>
EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

<b>BAM...
</b>
...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

<b>BAM...
</b>
...More dirt. She reacts again.

<b>BAM...
</b>
The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

<b>TILL...
</b>
They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

<b>TILL...
</b>
She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



<b>                        THE BRIDE
</b>             Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.
<b>
</b><b>                     THE BRIDE
</b>          Well, now that you've had a nice,
          good cry, let's figure out how to
          get out of here? You're breathing
          like you just been fuckin. Calm
          down...close your mouth, and start
          breathing short breaths, through
          your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          That's a lot better. But you're
          still too agitated. Can you hear
          your heart? It's like I'm buried
          alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
          that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
          you can. The darkness will have a
          calming effect. Now turn off that
          fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



<b>EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.

</b>

<b>                "SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"
</b>
A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



<b>                       BILL (V.O.)
</b>             Once upon a time in China, some
             believe around the year, one-double
             knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."
<b>
</b><b>                     BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
</b>          ...head priest of The White Lotus
          Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
          road, contemplating whatever a man
          with Pai Mei's infinite power would
          contemplate -- Which is another way
          of saying, who knows. When, a
          Shaolin monk appeared on the road
          traveling in the opposite
          direction. As the monk and the
          priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
          in a practically unfathomable
          display of generosity, gave the
          monk the slightest of nods. The
          nod, was not returned. Was it the
          intention of the Shaolin monk to
          insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
          fail to see the generous social
          gesture?
          The motives of the monk, remain,
          unknown. What is known, were the
          consequences. The next morning Pai
          Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
          and demanded that the temple's head
          Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
          repay the insult. The Abbot, at
          first, tried to console Pai Mei,
          only to find, Pai Mei was
          inconsolable. So began, the
          massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
          all sixty of the monks inside, at
          the fists of the White Lotus. And
          so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
          Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
          Technique.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
          exploding heart technique?



<b>                    BILL (V.O.)
</b>          Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
          all of the martial arts. He hits
          you with his fingertips, at ten
          different pressure points on your
          body. And then, he lets you walk
          away. But once you've taken five
          steps, your heart explodes inside
          your body, and you fall to the
          floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then
<b>
</b>fall to the floor dead.



<b>EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY
</b>
Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Did he teach you that?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          No. He teaches no one the ten-point
          palm - exploding heart technique.
          But he is Nietzsche's psalm
          personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
          kill you, he will make you
          stronger. Now one of the things I
          always liked about you, Kiddo, is
          you appear wise beyond your years.
          Then allow me to impart, a word to
          the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
          Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
          him - even for an instant - a
          defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
          And if you throw any American sass
          his way, he will snap your back and
          your neck like they were twigs, and
          that will be the story of you.



<b>EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          He'll accept you as his student.
<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Caught him in a good mood, aye?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Just seeing those steps again makes
          me ache. You're gonna have plenty
          of fun carrying buckets of water up
          and down that fucker.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Why did he accept me?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Because he's a very very very old
          man. And like all rotten bastards,
          when they get old, they become
          lonely. Not that that has any
          effect on their disposition. But
          they do learn the value of company.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          When will I see you again?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          That's the title of my favorite
          soul song of the Seventies.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          What?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Nothing. When he tells me you're
          done.
<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          When do you think that might be?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          That my dearest, all depends on
          you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
          sarcasm.
          Least not for the first year.
          You're going to have to let him
          warm up for you. He hates
          Caucasians, despises Americans, and
          has nothing but contempt for women,
          so in your case, that may take a
          little while. Adios.

<b>ZOOM...
</b>
The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



<b>INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE
</b>
The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



<b>                    THE BRIDE

          Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



<b>                    PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



<b>                    THE BRIDE

She climbs the wooden staircase.



<b>INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER
</b>
PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

* From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



<b>                     THE BRIDE *

</b>          Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
          understand a single word you say.
          It causes my ears discomfort. You
          are not to speak unless spoken to.
          Do you understand Mandarin any
          better than you speak it?

          can't understand me, I will
          communicate with you like I would a

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

<b>WE CUT TO PAI MEI
</b>He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.

</b>          I am proficient in a combination of
          Tiger and Crane style. And I am
          more than proficient in the
          exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>              (he makes a SNORTING
<b>               SOUND)
</b>          The exquisite art of the samurai
          sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
          called exquisite art, is only fit
          for Japanese fat heads. You really
          are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.
<b>
</b><b>                     PAI MEI *
</b>           Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



<b>                     THE BRIDE *

           your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

<b>THEN...
</b>
Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



<b>                     PAI MEI *
</b>           Your anger amuses me. Do you

<b>                     PAI MEI *
</b>           Then you must be stupid. Rise
           stupid, and let me get a better
<b>
</b>             look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



<b>                       PAI MEI *
</b>             You breathe hard. The one hundred
             steps robbed you of your wind. So
             your stupidity is matched only by
             your weakness. Is there anything
             you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
             Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
             Japs. I would of thought an
             American would be immune to their
             pompous posturing. Apparently I was
             wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



<b>                       PAI MEI *
</b>             Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



<b>                       PAI    MEI *
</b>             Let's see how    good you really are.
             Try and land    a blow. If you land a
             single blow,    I'll bow down and call
             you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;
<b>
</b><b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          an old man?

She tries more...



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
          cripples who posed more of a
          challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          From here you can get an excellent
          view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
<b>WALL.
</b>
The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,
<b>
</b>that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          That blade's sharp. Careful not to
          cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          If you can't fight any better than
          that, what use do you have for a
          leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.
<b>
</b><b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Your swordsmanship is amateur at
          best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
          and you can't even make me break a
          sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Let's see your Tiger and Crane
          style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          ...pathetic.....terrible...you
          idiot, you should've landed that
          blow...you call that crane?...
          Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          I asked you to show me what you
          know, and you did. Not a goddamn
          thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Like all yankee women, the only
          thing you know how to do is order
<b>
</b>          in restaurants and spend a man's
          money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
          a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;

<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          I could chop off your arm at will.
          I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;

<b>EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY
</b>
Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



<b>                    PAI MEI *

<b>                    THE BRIDE *

          three inches in front of you, what
          do you do then? Curl into a ball?
          Or do you put your fist through

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



<b>INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT
</b>
Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.

            and sleep like a human being, pick
            up those sticks.

She does.



<b>THE WOOD WALL
</b>
The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.

He walks off in a huff.



<b>EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).
<b>

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



<b>                    PAI MEI *
</b>          You are to go into that pit, and
          catch that rat, with your bare
          hands. If you catch the rat, I will
          deem you the victor, and tonight
          you will dine on bird. But, if you
          can't catch the rat by sundown,
          I'll deem the victor the rat. And
          because of the disgrace to my
          student, I will be forced to kill
          it. And then I will force you, to
          consume his body. Because to be my
          student, you must develop a taste
          for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

<b>WHEN...
</b>
A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.
<b>

With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where

<b>BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER
</b>
PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.
<b>
</b>Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

<b>THEN...
</b>
AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
More dirt...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
Even more dirt...

<b>AGAIN...
</b>
THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

<b>THEN...
</b>
Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



<b>EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT
</b>
A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the
<b>
</b>tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

<b>WHEN...
</b>
The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



<b>INT. DINER - NIGHT
</b>
A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

<b>SODA JERK'S POV:
</b>Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



<b>                    ELLE

          buried under?



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



<b>                    ELLE

<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          That's a Hanzo sword alright.

          got'em a job to do, they tend to
          live a little longer so they can do
          it. I've always figured warriors
          and their enemies share the same
          relationship. So now you ain't
          gonna hafta face your enemy on the
          battlefield no more, which "R" are

          well you feel one more than you
          feel the other. The question was
          which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Regret.

Elle looks at him.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



<b>                    BUDD
</b>          Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
<b>BUDD...
</b>
...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
          of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
          to introduce my friend, The Black
          Mamba.
              (gesturing towards the
               refridgerator)
          Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
          know before I picked up that little
          fella, I looked him up on the

               from her pocket)
<b>
</b>          Fascinating creature the Black
          Mamba. Listen to this,
              (reading from the notepad)
          "...In Africa, the saying goes, in
          the bush, an elephant can kill you.
          A leopard can kill you. And a Black
          Mamba can kill you. But only with
          the Mamba, and this has been true
          in Africa since the dawn of time,
          is death sure. Hence its handle;
          Death Incarnate."
              (looking up from the
               paper)
          Pretty cool, huh?
              (back to paper)
          "...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
          nature's most effective poisons,
          acting on the nervous system
          causing paralysis. The venom of a
          Black Mamba can kill a human in
          four hours, if say bitten on the
          ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
          to the face or torso can bring
          death from paralysis within twenty
          minutes.
              (up from paper to Budd)
          Now you should listen to this cause
          this concerns you.
              (reading from the paper)
          The amount of venom that can be
          delivered from a single bit can be
          gargantuan.
              (looks up from paper)
          -- You know I've always liked that
          word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
          have an opportunity to use it in a
          sentence.
              (back to paper)
          "If not treated quickly with anti
          venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
          fatal to human beings. However, the
          Black Mamba can deliver as much as
          100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
          a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.

          earlier, more thoroughly. When it
          comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
          "R's" in me. Revenge is one.
          Retribution is another. Rivalry is

          maybe the greatest warrior I have
          ever met, met her end at the hands
          of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky

          deserved better.

cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.

</b>Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



<b>EXT. DESERT
</b>
Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.
<b>
</b>A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>          Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
          alacky had got the best of you.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



<b>                    ELLE
</b>              (referring to the sword)

<b>                    THE BRIDE

</b>          He said he pawned it.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Guess that makes him a liar, don't
          it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.

<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          I was wondering, just 'tween us
          girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
          for him to snatch out your eye?

<b>FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE

<b>                    ELLE

<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Oooh, not so good.



<b>                    ELLE

Elle nods her head 'yes.'
<b>
</b><b>                    THE BRIDE

<b>                            ELLE
</b>          Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          I saw what you did to that little

          somebody your own size?




<b>                    ELLE
</b>          I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



<b>                            THE BRIDE
</b>          Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
          we get started. Hattori Hanzo
          swords are extremely sharp. They
          can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
          Careful not to cut your own arm
          off.



<b>                    ELLE

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You're gonna bleed though, you're
          gonna bleed a lot.

<b>THEN...
</b>
<b>SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
</b>
The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer
circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and
closer to each other....one baby step at a time...

Their Blonde Hair.

As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a
crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two
women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and
CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX....

Both women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing.

and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched.

The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to
the other one, as they prepare for their next attack...

Now they begin to circle again.

EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter
of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin
separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

<b>TIP.
</b>
We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

<b>ELLE,
</b><b>
</b>BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

Bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home (named Villa
Quatro) located on the beach in Mexico. At the moment Bill
partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

EX CU the BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



<b>                    JOSEPHINA
</b>          Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
          to leave now.



<b>                    BILL

          Do you like it?

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Why don't you put it on the dinner

<b>                    JOSEPHINA
</b>              (she takes it)
          Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Oh and Josephina, take the
          remaining flowers and spread them

<b>
</b><b>                    JOSEPHINA
</b>          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          You know I just had a great idea.
          Take the roses, and spread the
          petals on the bed I just got for
          her. That'd be a nice thing to come
          home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
          roses.



<b>                    JOSEPHINA

We follow behind Bill as he moves through his house...He
slips on his jacket...Grabs his keys...TWO energetic GERMAN
SHEPHERDS follow him out the front door onto his driveway.

On his way to his silver Porsche, he roughhouse plays with
the dogs, speaking to them in Spanish. When he gets to the
sports-car, the dogs won't leave him alone, and one jumps on
the Porsche. He yells at it in Spanish;

...watching...
A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride's Eye
every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

<b>BILL
</b>driving his convertible as the beach WHIZZES by in the
background.

The Bride's eye.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche
kicks up dirt ZOOMING down it.

<b>CU BILL
</b>driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



<b>INT. INSTITUTION
</b>
The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



<b>                    THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          The attentive    audience members
          among you will    have probably
          noticed, that    all my kills have
          been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



<b>                    THE BRIDE (V.O.)
</b>          Y'all figured I'd face him with my
<b>
</b>          Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
          Bill figured the same thing. I am
          the product of three godfathers.
          Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
          Different teachers teach you
          different things. But one thing I
          learned from all three, was "in
          combat, the opponent that does the
          unexpected, can usually expect to
          be the victor." Bill would never
          see this coming. Not from me. And
          least any of you judge me a
          bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
          who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

<b>WIDE SHOT
</b>looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
<b>SIGHT.
</b>
SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

<b>FLASH ON
</b>The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.

passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.

<b>                    BILL

What have you told her about me?



<b>          BILL
</b>That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a
<b>
</b>          picture of you --



<b>                    THE BRIDE

          was one and a half years old, she's
          slept with that picture of you next

</b>          When do we cross swords?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Well, it just so happens, my
          hacienda comes with its very own
          private beach. And my private
          beach, just so happens to look
          particularly beautiful bathed in
          moonlight. And there just so
          happens to be a full moon out
          tonight. So, swordfighter, if you
<b>
</b>          want to sword fight, that's where I
          suggest. But if you wanna be old
          school about it - then we can wait
          till dawn, and slice each other up
          at sunrise, like a couple real life
          honest to goodness samurais. As per
          usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
          decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Do me a courtesy?



<b>                      BILL
</b>          Anything.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Slow down as we pass...I want
          another look at her.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Wear something nice tonight?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          I have a dress all picked out.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Will I like it?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You said I looked beautiful last
          time you saw me in it.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.
<b>
</b>We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Now you just wait one second there
          little missy. Unless I'm confused,
          we are trying to kill each other
          aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
          taking a shot at you in front of
          the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
          if you're gonna forget everything I
          ever taught you, and gawk like you
          ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
          take a shot, am I not?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Did she wake up?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Of course not. She's like you that
          way.
          I look forward to this evening. It
          was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



<b>INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT
</b>
Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

</b>
His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.
<b>
</b><b>                    HANZO (JAPANESE)

</b>


<b>INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA
</b>
The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



<b>                    HANZO (JAPANESE)
</b>          Half of Bill's strength, lies in
          his talent for the unexpected.
          If you intend to vanquish this man,
          and claim your daughter, you must
          not only expect the unexpected. You
          must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.
<b>
</b>She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



<b>INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT
</b>
ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Hello Josephina.



<b>                    JOSEPHINA
</b>          Hello Miss Beatrix.
<b>
</b>She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



<b>                     THE BRIDE
</b>          Stay in here and don't come out. If

          comprende?



<b>                    JOSEPHINA
</b>          Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



<b>                    BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Kiddo! If you're through shooting
          the servants, I'm in the living
          room. You remember how to get to
          the living room, don'tcha? Go down
          to the end of the hall, and make a
          left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
<b>READY TO FIRE...
</b>
<b>WHEN...
</b>
EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



<b>                     BILL
</b>              (loudly)
          Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.
<b>
</b><b>                    BILL
</b>          Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
          you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
          are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
          know,...that five-year-old B.B.
          Gunn was only playing possum, due
          to the fact she was impervious to
          bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



<b>                     B.B.
</b><b>
</b>              (to Mommy)
          I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



<b>                    BILL
</b>              (to B.B.)
          Hey, get back down there, you're
          playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          So, as the smirking killer
          approached, what she thought, was a
          bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
          the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



<b>                       B.B.
</b>          Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
          known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          Don't die Mommy, I was just
          playing.
<b>
</b>From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



<b>                    MOMMY
</b>          I know baby.

They embrace each other.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          I waited a long time for you to
          wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
          - I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Now let me look at you. My my my...
          What a pretty girl you are.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>          Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          When I showed you Mommy's picture,
          tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



<b>                       BILL
</b><b>
</b>          C'mon shy girl, you know what you
          said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
          fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          I said - I said - You're the most
          beautiful woman I ever saw in the
          whole white world.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          That's the truth. That's what she
          said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          What's that?



<b>                    MOMMY
</b>          Oh, Mommy spilled something on her

<b>                    B.B.

<b>                    MOMMY

<b>                    B.B.
</b>          No.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Do you not like it, or do you not
          know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          I do not know what it is.
<b>
</b><b>                    MOMMY
</b>          Well, it's a very tasty beverage
          that I used to drink, when I was a
          little girl. It comes in a lot of
          different flavors and colors, and
          it's really good. Maybe we should
          fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



<b>                     BILL
</b>          Speaking of fixing and drinking and
          eating, I think it's dinner time
          don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



<b>                    BILL

          When you were doin all that fancy

          a nice Mexican woman about forty
          five years old, did ya?

               off his brow)
          Whew, then dinner should be done.
              (shouting to the other
               room)
          Josephina! You can come out now,
          we're ready for dinner.



<b>                    JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
</b>          Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Want to go on top of the world?
<b>
</b>She says excitedly;



<b>                      B.B.
</b>          Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



<b>INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at

<b>                      B.B.
</b><b>
</b>Why? Where you a bad daddy?



<b>          BILL
</b>I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
    (to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
    (to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



<b>          B.B.
</b>I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



<b>          BILL
</b>Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



<b>          B.B.
</b>I stepped on him.



<b>          BILL
</b>Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



<b>          B.B.
</b>Yeah.



<b>           BILL
</b>To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
    (beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the
<b>
</b>carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



<b>          B.B.
</b>He was -- flapping.



<b>          BILL
</b>And then you stomped on him?



<b>           B.B.
</b>Uh-huh.



<b>          BILL
</b>And when you lifted your foot up,

<b>           B.B.
</b>Nothing.



<b>          BILL
</b>He stopped flapping, didn't he?



<b>           B.B.

</b>    (to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



<b>          B.B.
</b>Uh-huh.



<b>          BILL
</b>And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



<b>          B.B.
</b>Uh-huh.



<b>          BILL
</b>So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they
<b>
</b>can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
    (to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



<b>            B.B.
</b>Uh-huh.



<b>          BILL
</b>Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



<b>          B.B.
</b>You stomped on Mommy?



<b>          BILL
</b>Worse.
    (making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



<b>            B.B.
</b>Why?



<b>          BILL
</b>I don't know.



<b>          B.B.
</b>Did you want to see what would
happen?



<b>            BILL
</b>No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



<b>          B.B.
</b>What happened?
<b>
</b><b>                    BILL
</b>          I was very sad. And that was when I
          learned, somethings once you do,
          they can never be undone.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          What happened to Mommy?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Why don't you ask Mommy.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          Did it make you sick?



<b>                    MOMMY
</b>          It put me to sleep. That's why I
          haven't been with you B.B., I've
          been asleep.



<b>                    B.B.
</b>          But you're awake now, right?



<b>                    MOMMY
</b>          I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



<b>EXT. PORCH - DAWN
</b>
Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.
<b>
</b>Between them the dawn sky breaks.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Did she go to sleep easy?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          It took her a little bit. She was
          excited. She's quite the little
          chatterbox.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Well, if she doesn't like you, you
          got to kill her to say hello. But
          if she likes you, you can't shut
          her up. She's a chip off the ole
          blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



<b>                      BILL
</b>          Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
          fun with a couple glasses of wine
          in ya.

She gives him a look.



<b>                    BILL
</b>              (pointing towards the
               beach)
          We're going to go out there and
          have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Well, I've already had    a glass. So
          unless you want to win    by an unfair
          advantage, you should    have a glass
          of wine. So we're both    on the same
          footing wine wise.
<b>
</b>She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          You know, there's an old man down
          here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
          He was a pimp. I knew him when I
          was a child. He was a friend of my
          mother's. I told him about you.
          When I showed him your picture he
          smiles and said;
              (imitating his accent)
          "Yesss, I see the attraction." He
          told me a story about taking me to
          the movies when I was five. It was
          a movie which had Lana Turner in
          it. And whenever she would appear
          on screen, he said I would stick my
          thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
          an obscure amount. And he knew
          right then, this boy will be a fool
          for blondes.

She gives him another look.

</b><b>                    BILL
</b>          I sent you to L.A. and you never

          killed. Do you know how cruel it is
          to make someone think someone they
          love is dead? I mourned you. Then
          in the third month of my mourning,
          I track you down. I wasn't trying
          to track you down, I was trying to
          track down - the fucking assholes -
          who I thought killed you. And when
          I find you, what to I find? Not
          only are you not dead, you're
          getting married - to some fuckin
          jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
          you expect me to react?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Why do you think I hid?



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Why did you leave in the first
          place? You have cold eyes towards
          me now. I understand their
          temperature, but they were warm the
          second to the last time I saw them,
          or was that just my imagination?



<b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>          No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



<b>                    THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          You sent me to L.A. to kill that
          lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



<b>                    BILL (ENGLISH)
</b>          You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;
<b>
</b><b>          THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
</b>What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



<b>          BILL
</b>You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



<b>          THE BRIDE
</b>The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



<b>          BILL
</b>But you never did.



<b>          THE BRIDE
</b>- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



<b>          BILL
</b>My apologies, please continue.



<b>          THE BRIDE
</b>So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to
<b>
</b>          kill me in my hotel room. As I was
          dancing in euphoria, the killer
          came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Hello, can I help you?



<b>                    HOTEL WOMAN
</b>          Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
          hospitality manager of the hotel. I
          have a welcome gift from the
          management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
          busy at this second, could you
          possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

<b>WHEN...
</b>
A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.
<b>
</b>The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



<b>                    KAREN
</b>          So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
          huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
          I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
          to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Wait a second!

Karen stops.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
          come here to kill your sister. But
          I'm not gonna do that now.

          right now - not two minutes before
          you blew a hole in the door, I'm

Karen looks at her, "what?".



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          On that table is the    home pregnancy
          kit. On the floor by    the door is
          the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
          I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
          want to and I won't    kill your
          sister. I just want    to go home.

<b>                    THE BRIDE

          percent right. But this time you're
          a hundred percent wrong. I'm the

          right now I'm scared shitless for
          my baby. Please, you hafta believe
          me. Look at the strip, it's on the
          floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



<b>                    KAREN
</b>          Sit down on that bed and put your
          hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Blue means pregnant.



<b>                    KAREN
</b>          I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



<b>                     KAREN
</b>          Okay, say I were to believe you,
          what then?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;
<b>
</b><b>                    KAREN
</b>          You fucked with the Wong sisters.



<b>BACK ON THE PORCH
</b>


<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Facing Karen Wong, was the most
          frightening moment I have ever
          experienced. And that includes
          three years with that evil bastard
          Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
          blue, I was a woman, I was your
          woman. I was a killer, who killed
          for you. Before that strip turned
          blue, I would have jumped a
          motorcycle on to a speeding train
          ...for you. But once that strip
          turned blue, I could no longer do
          any of those things. Not anymore.
          Because now I was a mother. A
          mother who only had one thought on
          her mind. Please don't harm my
          baby. Can you understand that?

<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You wouldn't have let me go.
          Specially once you found out I was
          pregnant. You would've tried to
          talk me out of it. It would have
          been a big scene. I just said fuck

          pregnant, once you knew, you'd
          claim it, and I didn't want that.
<b>
</b><b>                    BILL

</b>          Yes, but it's the right decision.
          And I made it for my daughter.
          Everybody on this earth deserves to
          start with a clean slate. But with
          us - my daughter would be born into
          a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
          her of the one thing everybody
          deserves. She would be born with
          blood stains. I had to choose. I
          chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



<b>                     THE BRIDE

          get literal.
              (beat)
          There are consequences to breaking
          the heart of a murdering bastard.
          You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          You and I have unfinished business.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



<b>                     BILL
</b>          You know how proud I am of you,
          don't you?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Yes.



<b>                     BILL
</b>          You know I was rooting for you,
          don't you?
<b>
</b><b>                       THE BRIDE
</b>          I figured.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          You know on that beach out there I
          want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          You also know you're going to have
          to defeat me. I can't just give it
          to you, even though I want to.



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          It won't be necessary for you to
          give me anything. I've surpassed
          you. I'll take it.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Well, as they say in Missouri, show
          me.



<b>EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING
</b>
As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

<b>BILL
</b>stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

<b>WIDE SHOT
</b>The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge/attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right
<b>
</b>empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



<b>                       THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
</b>          Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



<b>                    BILL
</b>              (to himself)
          That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

<b>TILL...
</b>
They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



<b>                       BILL
</b><b>
</b>          He taught you the ten point palm
          exploding heart technique?



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          Of course he did.



<b>                    BILL
</b>          Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



<b>                    THE BRIDE
</b>          I don't know...Because...I'm
          a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



<b>                    BILL
</b>          No. You're not a bad person. You're
          a terrific person. You're my
          favorite person. But every once in
          awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.
<b>
</b>The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
<b>SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
</b>As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



<b>INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.
<b>
</b>Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

<b>TWO SHOT CU
</b>Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to
each other, watching T.V.

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right
in the jungle.

</html>                                     MR. BROWN
                         "Like a Virgin" is all about a girl 
                         who digs a guy with a big dick. The 
                         whole song is a metaphor for big 
                         dicks.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         No it's not. It's about a girl who 
                         is very vulnerable and she's been 
                         fucked over a few times. Then she 
                         meets some guy who's really sensitive -

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Whoa... whoa... time out Greenbay. 
                         Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

                                     JOE
                              (looking through his 
                              address book)
                         Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... 
                         Toby... think... think... think...

                                     MR. BROWN
                         It's not about a nice girl who meets 
                         a sensitive boy. Now granted that's 
                         what "True Blue" is about, no argument 
                         about that.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Which one is "True Blue?"

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         You don't remember "True Blue?" That 
                         was a big ass hit for Madonna. Shit, 
                         I don't even follow this Tops In 
                         Pops shit, and I've at least heard 
                         of "True Blue."

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't 
                         heard of it. All I asked was how 
                         does it go? Excuse me for not being 
                         the world's biggest Madonna fan.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I hate Madonna.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         I like her early stuff. You know, 
                         "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but 
                         once she got into her "Papa Don't 
                         Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned 
                         out.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a 
                         point here. You're gonna make me 
                         lose my train of thought.

                                     JOE
                         Oh fuck, Toby's that little china 
                         girl.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's that?

                                     JOE
                         I found this old address book in a 
                         jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. 
                         Toby what? What the fuck was her 
                         last name?

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Where was I?

                                     MR. PINK
                         You said "True Blue" was about a 
                         nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. 
                         But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor 
                         for big dicks.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s 
                         about. It's about some cooze who's a 
                         regular fuck machine. I mean all the 
                         time, morning, day, night, afternoon, 
                         dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, 
                         dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         How many dicks was that?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         A lot.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Then one day she meets a John Holmes 
                         motherfucker, and it's like, whoa 
                         baby. This mother fucker's like 
                         Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." 
                         He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's 
                         gettin' this serious dick action, 
                         she's feelin' something she ain't 
                         felt since forever. Pain.

                                     JOE
                         Chew? Toby Chew? No.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't 
                         hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum 
                         by now. But when this cat fucks her, 
                         it hurts. It hurts like the first 
                         time. The pain is reminding a fuck 
                         machine what is was like to be a 
                         virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."

               The fellas crack up.

                                     JOE
                         Wong?

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the 
                         fuck do you know about it anyway? 
                         You're still listening to Jerry-
                         fucking-Vale.

                                     JOE
                         Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, 
                         like the Chinese name?

               Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They 
               fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Give me this fucking thing.

                                     JOE
                         What the fuck do you think you're 
                         doin'? Give me my book back!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; 
                         I'll give it back when we leave.

                                     JOE
                         Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we 
                         leave, give it back now.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For the past fifteen minutes now, 
                         you've just been droning on with 
                         names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby 
                         Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... 
                         fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's 
                         big dick outta my right ear, and 
                         Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my 
                         left.

                                     JOE
                         What do you care?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         When you're annoying as hell, I care 
                         a lot.

                                     JOE
                         Give me my book.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You gonna put it away?

                                     JOE
                         I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do 
                         with it.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna 
                         have to keep it.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Joe, you want me to shoot him for 
                         you?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you 
                         better wake up and apologize.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Have you guys been listening to K-
                         BILLY's super sounds of the seventies 
                         weekend?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Can you believe the songs they been 
                         playin'?

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, I can't. You know what I heard 
                         the other day? "Heartbeat-It's 
                         Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco 
                         and the DeFranco Family. I haven't 
                         heard that since I was in fifth 
                         fuckin' grade.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         When I was coming down here, I was 
                         playin' it. And "The Night the Lights 
                         Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I 
                         ain't heard that song since it was 
                         big, but when it was big, I heard it 
                         a million-trillion times. I'm 
                         listening to it this morning, and 
                         this was the first time I ever 
                         realized that the lady singing the 
                         song, was the one who killed Andy.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed 
                         the guy?

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         They say it in the song.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I know, I heard it. I musta zoned 
                         out whenever that part came on before. 
                         I thought when she said that little 
                         sister stuff, she was talkin' about 
                         her sister-in-law, the cheatin' wife.

                                     JOE
                         No, she did it. She killed the 
                         cheatin' wife, too.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who gives a damn?

               The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She 
               has the check, and a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody more coffee.

                                     JOE
                         No, we're gonna be hittin' it. I'll 
                         take care of the check.

               She hands the bill to him.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Here ya go. Please pay at the 
                         register, if you wouldn't mind.

                                     JOE
                         Sure thing.

                                     WAITRESS
                         You guys have a wonderful day.

               They all mutter equivalents. She exits and Joe stands up.

                                     JOE
                         I'll take care of this, you guys 
                         leave the tip.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         And when I come back, I want my book 
                         back.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Sorry, it's my book now.

                                     JOE
                         Blonde, shoot this piece of shit, 
                         will ya?

               Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Mr. White acts 
               shot. Joe exits.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Okay, everybody cough up green for 
                         the little lady.

               Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. 
               Everybody, that is, except Mr. Pink.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         C'mon, throw in a buck.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Uh-uh. I don't tip.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't believe in it.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         You don't believe in tipping?

                                     MR. BROWN
                              (laughing)
                         I love this guy, he's a madman, this 
                         guy.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Do you have any idea what these ladies 
                         make? They make shit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Don't give me that. She don't make 
                         enough money, she can quit.

               Everybody laughs.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I don't even know a Jew who'd have 
                         the balls to say that. So let's get 
                         this straight. You never ever tip?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't tip because society says I 
                         gotta. I tip when somebody deserves 
                         a tip. When somebody really puts 
                         forth an effort, they deserve a little 
                         something extra. But this tipping 
                         automatically, that shit's for the 
                         birds. As far as I'm concerned, 
                         they're just doin' their job.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         Our girl was nice.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Our girl was okay. She didn't do 
                         anything special.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         What's something special, take ya in 
                         the kitchen and suck your dick?

               They all laugh.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         I'd go over twelve percent for that.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've 
                         been here a long fuckin' time, and 
                         she's only filled my cup three times. 
                         When I order coffee, I want it filled 
                         six times.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What if she's too busy?

                                     MR. PINK
                         The words "too busy" shouldn't be in 
                         a waitress's vocabulary.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last 
                         thing you need is another cup of 
                         coffee.

               They all laugh.

                                     MR. PINK
                         These ladies aren't starvin' to death. 
                         They make minimum wage. When I worked 
                         for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky 
                         enough to have a job that society 
                         deemed tipworthy.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         Ahh, now we're getting down to it. 
                         It's not just that he's a cheap 
                         bastard -

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         It is that too -

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE
                         It is that too. But it's also he 
                         couldn't get a waiter job. You talk 
                         like a pissed off dishwasher: "Fuck 
                         those cunts and their fucking tips."

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         So you don't care that they're 
                         counting on your tip to live?

               Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Do you know what this is? It's the 
                         world's smallest violin, playing 
                         just for the waitresses.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You don't have any idea what you're 
                         talking about. These people bust 
                         their ass. This is a hard job.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So's working at McDonald's, but you 
                         don't feel the need to tip them. 
                         They're servin' ya food, you should 
                         tip em. But no, society says tip 
                         these guys over here, but not those 
                         guys over there. That's bullshit.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         They work harder than the kids at 
                         McDonald's.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning 
                         fryers.

                                     MR. BLUE
                         These people are taxed on the tips 
                         they make. When you stiff 'em, you 
                         cost them money.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Waitressing is the number one 
                         occupation for female non-college 
                         graduates in this country. It's the 
                         one job basically any woman can get, 
                         and make a living on. The reason is 
                         because of tips.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck all that.

               They all laugh.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Hey, I'm very sorry that the 
                         government taxes their tips. That's 
                         fucked up. But that ain't my fault. 
                         it would appear that waitresses are 
                         just one of the many groups the 
                         government fucks in the ass on a 
                         regular basis. You show me a paper 
                         says the government shouldn't do 
                         that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote, 
                         I'll vote for it. But what I don't 
                         do is play ball. And this non-college 
                         bullshit you're telling me, I got 
                         two words for that: "Learn to fuckin' 
                         type." Cause if you're expecting me 
                         to help out with the rent, you're in 
                         for a big fuckin' surprise.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He's convinced me. Give me my dollar 
                         back.

               Everybody laughs. Joe's comes back to the table.

                                     JOE
                         Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. 
                         Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Mr. Pink.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Mr. Pink?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Why?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He don't tip.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         He don't tip?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You don't tip? Why?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         He don't believe in it.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         He don't believe in it?
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You don't believe in it?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Nope.

                                     JOE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Shut up!
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, 
                         I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Because you paid for the breakfast, 
                         I'm gonna tip. Normally I wouldn't.

                                     JOE
                         Whatever. Just throw in your dollar, 
                         and let's move.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         See what I'm dealing with here. 
                         Infants. I'm fuckin' dealin' with 
                         infants.

               The eight men get up to leave. Mr. White's waist is in the 
               F.G. As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying 
               a gun. They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House, talking amongst 
               themselves.

               EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

               CREDIT SEQUENCE

               When the credit sequence is finished, we FADE TO BLACK:

               Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in 
               agony.

               Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING ASS, 
               through traffic.

               Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY 
               ELSE SAY:

                                     SOMEBODY ELSE (O.S.)
                         Just hold on buddy boy.

               Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

                                     SOMEBODY (O.S.)
                         I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed 
                         me. Who would've fuckin' thought 
                         that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the backseat. 
               He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both him and the 
               backseat.

               Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of the 
               getaway car. He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of 
               traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking 
               to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

               They are the only two in the car.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Hey, just cancel that shit right 
                         now! You're hurt. You're hurt really 
                         fucking bad, but you ain't dying.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (crying)
                         All this blood is scaring the shit 
                         outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you 
                         had a degree in medicine. Are you a 
                         doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me 
                         please, are you a doctor?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         No, I'm not!

                                     MR. WRITE
                         Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know 
                         what you're talking about. So if 
                         you're through giving me your amateur 
                         opinion, lie back and listen to the 
                         news. I'm taking you back to the 
                         rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a 
                         doctor, the doctor's gonna fix you 
                         up, and you're gonna be okay. Now 
                         say it: You're gonna be okay. Say 
                         it: You're gonna be okay!

               Mr. Orange doesn't respond. Mr. White starts pounding on the 
               steering wheel.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna 
                         be okay!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm okay.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (softly)
                         Correct.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse. Then the 
               door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of 
               Mr. Orange inside.

               Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

               Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and 
                         wait for Joe. I can't do anything 
                         for you, but when Joe gets here, 
                         which should be anytime now, he'll 
                         be able to help you. We're just gonna 
                         sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are 
                         we waiting for?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Joe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Bet your sweet ass we are.

               Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl 
               around the warehouse.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (yelling)
                         Don't leave me!

               Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I ain't going anywhere. I'm right 
                         here. I'm not gonna leave ya.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Larry, I'm so scared, would you please 
                         hold me.

               Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange. Cradling 
               the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (whispering)
                         Go ahead and be scared, you've been 
                         brave enough for one day. I want you 
                         to just relax now. You're not gonna 
                         die, you're gonna be fine. When Joe 
                         gets here, he'll make ya a hundred 
                         percent again.

               Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's 
               still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the 
                         ointment, but if help doesn't come 
                         soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't 
                         give a fuck about jail, I just don't 
                         wanna die.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You're not gonna fucking die, all 
                         right?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, 
                         and I'm hurt bad.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         It's not good...

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Hey, bless your heart for what you're 
                         trying to do. I was panicking for a 
                         moment, but I've got my senses back 
                         now. The situation is, I'm shot in 
                         the belly. And without medical 
                         attention, I'm gonna die.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I can' take you to a hospital.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about 
                         jail. But I can't die. You don't 
                         have to take me in. Just drive me up 
                         to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. 
                         I'll take care of myself. I won't 
                         tell them anything. I swear to fucking 
                         god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look 
                         in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
                              (Mr. White does)
                         I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll 
                         be safe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Lie back down, and try to -

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm going to die! I need a doctor! 
                         I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.

               Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from 
               his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Take me to a doctor, take me to a 
                         doctor, please.

               Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps 
               inside.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Was that a fucking set-up or what?

               Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

               Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Gun shot.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh that's just fucking great! Where's 
                         Brown?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Dead.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How the fuck do you think? The cops 
                         shot him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Orange)
                         Is it bad?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         As opposed to good?

                                     MR. PINK
                         This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked 
                         us big time.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You really think we were set up?

                                     MR. PINK
                         You even doubt it? I don't think we 
                         got set up, I know we got set up! I 
                         mean really, seriously, where did 
                         all those cops come from, huh? One 
                         minute they're not there, the next 
                         minute they're there. I didn't hear 
                         any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. 
                         Okay, when an alarm goes off, you 
                         got an average of four minutes 
                         response time. Unless a patrol car 
                         is cruising that street, at that 
                         particular moment, you got four 
                         minutes before they can realistically 
                         respond. In one minute there were 
                         seventeen blue boys out there. All 
                         loaded for bear, all knowing exactly 
                         what the fuck they were doing, and 
                         they were all just there! Remember 
                         that second wave that showed up in 
                         the cars? Those were the ones 
                         responding to the alarm. But those 
                         other motherfuckers were already 
                         there, they were waiting for us.
                              (pause)
                         You haven't thought about this?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I haven't had a chance to think. 
                         First I was just trying to get the 
                         fuck outta there. And after we got 
                         away, I've just been dealin' with 
                         him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well, you better start thinking about 
                         it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking 
                         about it. In fact, that's all I'm 
                         thinking about. I came this close to 
                         just driving off. Whoever set us up, 
                         knows about this place. There could've 
                         been cops sitting here waiting for 
                         me. For all we know, there's cops, 
                         driving fast, on their way here now.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Let's go in the other room...

               The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We move 
               past it, and see down a hall.

               INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

               At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door is 
               partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is obscured, 
               but Mr. White is in view.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         What the fuck am I doing here? I 
                         felt funny about this job right off. 
                         As soon as I felt it I should said 
                         "No thank you", and walked. But I 
                         never fucking listen. Every time I 
                         ever got burned buying weed, I always 
                         knew the guy wasn't right. I just 
                         felt it. But I wanted to believe 
                         him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it 
                         really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. 
                         But it's never Thai stick. And I 
                         always said if I felt that way about 
                         a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I 
                         didn't, because of fuckin' money!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's done is done, I need you cool. 
                         Are you cool?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'm cool.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Splash some water on your face. Take 
                         a breather.

               We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on 
               his face.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I'm gonna get me my smokes.

               Mr. White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and 
               OUT OF FRAME. We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards us, 
               bent over the sink. Then he grabs a towels, and dries his 
               face. Mr. White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of Chesterfields in 
               his hand.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Want a smoke?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why not?

               The two men light up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Okay, let's go through what happened. 
                         We're in the place, everything's 
                         going fine. Then the alarm gets 
                         tripped. I turn around and all these 
                         cops are outside. You're right, it 
                         was like, bam! I blink my eyes are 
                         they're there. Everybody starts going 
                         apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts 
                         shootin' all the -

                                     MR. PINK
                         That's not correct.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's wrong with it?

                                     MR. PINK
                         The cops didn't show up after the 
                         alarm went off. They didn't show 
                         till after Mr. Blonde started shooting 
                         everyone.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw 
                         the cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. 
                         They didn't let their presence be 
                         known until after Mr. Blonde went 
                         off. I'm not sayin' they weren't 
                         there, I'm sayin' they were there. 
                         But they didn't move in till Mr. 
                         Blonde became a madman. That's how I 
                         know we were set up. You can see 
                         that, can't you, Mr. White?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -

                                     MR. PINK
                         Don't tell me your name, I don't 
                         want to know! I sure as hell ain't 
                         gonna tell ya mine.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You're right, this is bad.
                              (pause)
                         How did you get out?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Shot my way out. Everybody was 
                         shooting, so I just blasted my way 
                         outta there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

               Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk. He has a 
               canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357 
               MAGNUM in the other. If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he 
               just knocks them down. We DOLLY at the same speed, right 
               along side of him.

               FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink. We DOLLY with 
               them.

               We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates. ROLLERGIRL is 
               plugged into a walkman. We hear the song she's listening to 
               LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK. She's twirling and skating backwards 
               to the beat of the song.

               Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink. The 
               man and woman CRASH to the ground.

               Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car 
               that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over 
               him.

               INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

               The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the car's 
               driver. Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood, shakes it 
               off, and points his magnum at the driver.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Get outta the car! Get the fuck outta 
                         the car!

               The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

               Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's 
               locked.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Open the fucking door!

               EXTREME CLOSEUP - DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

               Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

               Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

               The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

               Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at the 
               Cops.

               Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

               Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

               Cops FIRE.

               INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it. SPEEDING down 
               the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               The young cop takes off running and firing after the getaway 
               car. It's no use. Mr. Pink leaves him in the dust.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Tagged a couple of cops. Did you 
                         kill anybody?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         A few cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No real people?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Uh-uh, just cops.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That was one of the most insane 
                         fucking things I've ever seen. Why 
                         the fuck would Joe hire somebody 
                         like that?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I 
                         gotta get out that door, and you're 
                         standing in my way, one way of the 
                         other, you're gettin' outta my way.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That's the way I look at it. A choice 
                         between doin' ten years, and takin' 
                         out some stupid motherfucker, ain't 
                         no choice at all. But I ain't no 
                         madman either. What the fuck was Joe 
                         thinkin'? You can't work with a guy 
                         like that. That motherfucker's 
                         unstable. What do you think? Do you 
                         think he panicked, or ya think he's 
                         just trigger-happy?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! 
                         We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't 
                         tag us, when he shot up the place. I 
                         came this fucking close -
                              (hold up two fingers 
                              and makes a tiny 
                              space between them)
                         to taking his ass out myself. 
                         Everybody panics. When things get 
                         tense, everybody panics. Everybody. 
                         I don't care what your name is, you 
                         can't help it. It's human nature. 
                         But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic 
                         in your head. Ya give yourself a 
                         couple a seconds of panic, then you 
                         get a grip and deal with the 
                         situation. What you don't do, is 
                         shoot up the place and kill everybody.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What you're supposed to do is act 
                         like a fuckin' professional. A 
                         psychopath is not a professional. 
                         You can't work with a psychopath, 
                         'cause ya don't know what those sick 
                         assholes are gonna do next. I mean, 
                         Jesus Christ, how old do you think 
                         that black girl was? Twenty, maybe 
                         twenty-one?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Did ya see what happened to anybody 
                         else?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car 
                         and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, 
                         I don't know what went down.

                                     MR. PINK
                         At that point it became every man 
                         for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or 
                         Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got 
                         the foggiest. Once I got out, I never 
                         looked back.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What do you think?

                                     MR. PINK
                         What do I think? I think the cops 
                         caught them, or killed 'em.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Not even a chance they punched 
                         through? You found a hole.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. 
                         But if they did get away, where the 
                         fuck are they?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You don't think it's possible, one 
                         of them got a hold of the diamonds 
                         and pulled a -

                                     MR. PINK
                         Nope.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How can you be so sure?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got the diamonds.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got 'em, all right?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where? Are they out in the car?

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, they're not in the car. No, I 
                         don't have them on me. Ya wanna go 
                         with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go 
                         right now. But first listen to what 
                         I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set 
                         up! Somebody is in league with the 
                         cops. We got a Judas in our midst. 
                         And I'm thinkin' we should have our 
                         fuckin' heads examined for waiting 
                         around here.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That was the plan, we meet here.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Then where is everybody? I say the 
                         plan became null and void once we 
                         found out we got a rat in the house. 
                         We ain't got the slightest fuckin' 
                         idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or 
                         Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or 
                         arrested. They could be sweatin' 
                         'em, down at the station house right 
                         now. Yeah they don't know the names, 
                         but they can sing about this place. 
                         I mean, that could be happening right 
                         now. As we speak, the cops could be 
                         in their cars, drivin' here this 
                         minute.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.

                                     MR. PINK
                         What?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Two jobs back, it was a four man 
                         job, we discovered one of the team 
                         was an undercover cop.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No shit?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Thank god, we discovered in time. We 
                         hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. 
                         Just walked away from it.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? 
                         Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he 
                         set this whole thing up. Maybe he 
                         set it up to set it up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a 
                         long time. I can tell ya straight 
                         up, Joe definitely didn't have 
                         anything to do with this bullshit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. 
                         I known Joe since I was a kid. But 
                         me saying Joe definitely couldn't 
                         have done it is ridiculous. I can 
                         say I definitely didn't do it, cause 
                         I know what I did or didn't do. But 
                         I can't definitely say that about 
                         anybody else, 'cause I don't 
                         definitely know. For all I know, 
                         you're the rat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For all I know, you're the rat.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Now you're using your head. For all 
                         we know, he's the rat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That kid in there is dying from a 
                         fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. 
                         So don't be calling him a rat.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's 
                         a fuckin' rat. How many times do I 
                         hafta say it before it sinks in your 
                         skull?

               The talking stops. The two men just stare at each other. Mr. 
               Pink breaks the silence.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I gotta take a squirt, where's the 
                         commode in this dungeon?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Go down the hall, turn left, up those 
                         stairs, then turn right.

               Mr. Pink exits frame, leaving Mr. White alone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the background we see what looks like an office set up.

                                     VOICE
                         How's Alabama?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Alabama? I haven't seen Alabama over 
                         a year and a half.

                                     VOICE
                         I thought you two were a team.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We were for a little while. Did about 
                         four jobs together. Then decided to 
                         call it quits. You push it long enough 
                         that woman man thing gets in your 
                         way after a while.

               We now cut to see Joe behind his desk.

                                     JOE
                         What's she doin' now?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've 
                         done a couple a jobs together. Good 
                         little thief. So, explain the 
                         telegram.

                         Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' 
                         out of a diamond wholesaler's.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Can you move the ice afterwards? I 
                         don't know nobody who can move ice.

                                     JOE
                         Not a problem, got guys waitin' for 
                         it. But what happened to Marsellus 
                         Spivey? Didn't he always move your 
                         ice?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.

                                     JOE
                         What for?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Bad luck. What's the exposure like?

                                     JOE
                         Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two 
                         minutes. It's daylight, during 
                         business hours, dealing with a crowd. 
                         But you'll have the guys to deal 
                         with the crowd.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How many employees?

                                     JOE
                         Around twenty. Security pretty lax. 
                         They almost always just deal in boxes. 
                         Rough uncut stones they get from the 
                         syndicate. On a certain day this 
                         wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment 
                         of polished stones from Israel. 
                         They're like a way station. They are 
                         gonna get picked up the next day and 
                         sent to Vermont.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         No, they're not.

               The men share a laugh.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's the cut, poppa?

                                     JOE
                         Juicy, junior, real juicy.

               BACK TO THE GARAGE

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               We follow Mr. Pink, HANDHELD, back through the rooms and 
               hallways to the garage. We follow behind him up to Mr. White, 
               who's standing over Mr. Orange.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So, I don't know about you, but me - 
                         I'm gonna split, check into a motel 
                         and lay low for a few days.

               As he gets closer he sees Mr. Orange is out. He runs over to 
               them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So, is he dead or what?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He ain't dead.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So what is it?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I think he's just passed out.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He scared the fuckin' shit outta me. 
                         I thought he was dead fer sure.

               Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He will be dead fer sure, if we don't 
                         get him to a hospital.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We can't take him to a hospital.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Without medical attention, this man 
                         won't live through the night. That 
                         bullet in his belly is my fault. Now 
                         while that might not mean jack shit 
                         to you, it means a helluva lot to 
                         me. And I'm not gonna just sit around 
                         and watch him die.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well, first things first, staying 
                         here's goofy. We gotta book up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         So what do you suggest, we go to a 
                         hotel? We got a guy who's shot in 
                         the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds 
                         like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, 
                         he screams in pain.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You gotta idea, spit it out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe could help him. If we can get in 
                         touch with Joe, Joe could get him to 
                         a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to 
                         come and see him.

               During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a CLOSEUP of 
               Mr. White.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Assuming we can trust Joe, how we 
                         gonna get in touch with him? He's 
                         supposed to be here, but he ain't, 
                         which is making me nervous about 
                         being here. Even if Joe is on the up 
                         and up, he's probably not gonna be 
                         that happy with us. Joe planned a 
                         robbery, but he's got a blood bath 
                         on his hands now. Dead cops, dead 
                         robbers, dead civilians... Jesus 
                         Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna 
                         have a lot of sympathy for our plight. 
                         If I was him, I'd try and put as 
                         much distance between me and this 
                         mess an humanly possible.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Before you got here, Mr. Orange was 
                         askin' me to take him to a hospital. 
                         Now I don't like turning him over to 
                         the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. 
                         He begged me to do it. I told him to 
                         hold off till Joe got here.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're 
                         on our own. Now, I don't know a 
                         goddamn body who can help him, so if 
                         you know somebody, call 'em.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         I don't know anybody.

                                     MR. PINK (O.S.)
                         Well, I guess we drop him off at the 
                         hospital. Since he don't know nothin' 
                         about us, I say it's his decision.

               MR. WHITE'S POV:

               CLOSEUP - MR. PINK

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Well, he knows a little about me.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You didn't tell him your name, did 
                         ya?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         I told him my first name, and where 
                         I'm from.

               There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then 
               he SCREAMS:

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why!

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         I told him where I was from a few 
                         days ago. It was just a casual 
                         conversation.

                                     MR. PINK
                         And what was tellin him your name 
                         when you weren't supposed to?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         He asked.

               Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         We had just gotten away from the 
                         cops. He just got shot. It was my 
                         fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a 
                         fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. 
                         I swear to god, I thought we was 
                         gonna die right then and there. I'm 
                         tryin' to comfort him, telling him 
                         not to worry, he's gonna be okay, 
                         I'm gonna take care of him. And he 
                         asked me what my name was. I mean, 
                         the man was dyin' in my arms. What 
                         the fuck was I supposed to tell him, 
                         "Sorry, I can't give out that 
                         information, it's against the rules. 
                         I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I 
                         shoulda, but I couldn't.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh, I don't doubt is was quite 
                         beautiful -

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Don't fuckin' patronize me.

                                     MR. PINK
                         One question: Do they have a sheet 
                         on you, where you told him you're 
                         from?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Of course.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Well that's that, then. I mean, I 
                         was worried about mug shot 
                         possibilities already. But now he 
                         knows: (a) what you look like, (b) 
                         what your first name is, (c) where 
                         you're from and (d) what your 
                         specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta 
                         show him a helluva lot of pictures 
                         for him to pick you out. That's it 
                         right, you didn't tell him anything 
                         else that could narrow down the 
                         selection?

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         If I have to tell you again to back 
                         off, me an you are gonna go round 
                         and round.

               Mr. Pink walks out of the CLOSEUP and turns his back on Mr. 
               White. Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We ain't taking him to a hospital.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         If we don't, he'll die.

                                     MR. PINK
                         And I'm very sad about that. But 
                         some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         That fuckin did it!

               Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

               Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the 
               mouth.

               END OF POV

               Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic 
               fight. They go at each other like a couple of alley cats.

               As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You little motherfucker!

               Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

                                     MR. PINK
                         Ya wanna fuck with me?! I'll show 
                         you who you're fuckin with!

               The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. Mr. 
               White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

               Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it 
               out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, 
               and goes for his own weapon.

               The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their 
               guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You wanna shoot me, you little piece 
                         of shit? Take a shot!

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck you, White! I didn't create 
                         this situation, I'm just dealin' 
                         with it. You're acting like a first-
                         year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a 
                         professional. They get him, they can 
                         get you, they get you, they get closer 
                         to me, and that can't happen. And 
                         you, you motherfucker, are looking 
                         at me like it's my fault. I didn't 
                         tell him my name. I didn't tell him 
                         where I was from. I didn't tell him 
                         what I knew better than to tell him. 
                         Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost 
                         told me your name. You, buddy, are 
                         stuck in a situation you created. So 
                         if you wanna throw bad looks 
                         somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

               Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

                                     MR. PINK
                         So if you wanna shoot somebody, put 
                         that gun in your mouth and shoot 
                         yourself.

               Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         You kids don't play so rough. 
                         Somebody's gonna start crying.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM CLOSEUP ON MR. BLONDE

               The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

               Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and 
               eating a hot dog.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought you 
                         might've gotten caught. What happened?

               Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and 
               starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out.

               He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just 
               eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

               This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr. Pink 
               tries to talk through it.

               We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Really, how did you get away?

               Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.

                                     MR. PINK
                         You saw what happened to me, I found 
                         a hole and booked.

               Silence.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Where's Mr. Blue?

               Blonde looks in the bathroom.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were hopin' you two would be 
                         together.

               Blonde looks out the window.

                                     MR. PINK
                         That was the big question we had, 
                         what happened to Mr. Blue and you?

               Blonde walks away from the window.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were worried the cops got ya.

               Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He got it in the belly. He's still 
                         alive, but won't be for long.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Enough! You better start talkin' to 
                         us, asshole, cause we got shit we 
                         need to talk about. We're already 
                         freaked out, we need you actin freaky 
                         like we need a fuckin' bag on our 
                         hip.

               Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves 
               towards them.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         So, talk.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We think we got a rat in the house.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I guarantee we got a rat in the house.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What would ever make you think that?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Is that supposed to be funny?

                                     MR. PINK
                         We don't think this place is safe.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         This place just ain't secure anymore. 
                         We're leaving, and you should go 
                         with us.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Nobody's going anywhere.

               Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.

               After a few beats the silence is broken.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         Piss on this turd, we're outta here.

               Mr. White turns to leave.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Don't take another step, Mr. White.

               Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. 
               Blonde.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Fuck you, maniac! It's your fuckin' 
                         fault we're in so much trouble.

               Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. He looks to Mr. Pink.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              White)
                         What's this guy's problem?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta 
                         problem. I gotta big problem with 
                         any trigger-happy madman who almost 
                         gets me shot!

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         What're you talkin' about?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That fuckin' shooting spree in the 
                         store.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, 
                         they deserve what they got.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You almost killed me, asshole! If I 
                         had any idea what type of guy you 
                         were, I never would've agreed to 
                         work with you.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         You gonna bark all day, little doggie, 
                         or are you gonna bite?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't 
                         catch it. Would you repeat it?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (slowly)
                         I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, 
                         dog, or are you gonna bite."

                                     MR. PINK
                         Both of you two assholes knock it 
                         the fuck off and calm down!

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Blonde)
                         So you wanna git bit, huh?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a 
                         fuckin' playground!
                              (pause)
                         I don't believe this shit, both of 
                         you got ten years on me, and I'm the 
                         only one actin like a professional. 
                         You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' 
                         niggers. You ever work a job with a 
                         bunch of niggers? They're just like 
                         you two, always fightin', always 
                         sayin' they're gonna kill one another.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         You said yourself, you thought about 
                         takin' him out.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Then. That time has passed. Right 
                         now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I 
                         completely trust. He's too fuckin' 
                         homicidal to be workin' with the 
                         cops.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You takin' his side?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Fuck sides! What we need is a little 
                         solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' 
                         a red hot poker up our asses and we 
                         gotta find out whose hand's on the 
                         handle. Now I know I'm no piece of 
                         shit...
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              White)
                         And I'm pretty sure you're a good 
                         boy...
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Blonde)
                         And I'm fuckin positive you're on 
                         the level. So let's figure out who's 
                         the bad guy.

               Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

               Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning, 
               talking about Madonna.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Well, that was sure exciting.
                              (to Mr. White)
                         You're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't 
                         you? Me too. I don't know about the 
                         rest of you fellas, but my heart's 
                         beatin' fast.
                              (pause for a beat)
                         Okay you guys, follow me.

               Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

               The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Follow you where?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Down to my car.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Why?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         It's a surprise.

               Mr. Blonde walks out.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking towards 
               the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind. 
               The Camera is HANDHELD following behind them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We still gotta get out of here.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         We're gonna sit here and wait.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         For what, the cops?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Nice Guy Eddie.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think 
                         Nice Guy's anywhere but on a plane 
                         half way to Costa Rica?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Cause I just talked to him. He's on 
                         his way down here, and nobody's going 
                         anywhere till be gets here.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why 
                         the fuck didn't you say that in the 
                         first place?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         You didn't ask.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look 
                         at the little surprise I brought 
                         you.

               Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car. A handcuffed, 
               uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Since we got to wait for Nice Guy 
                         Eddie anyway, let's talk to our boy 
                         in blue here and see if he knows 
                         anything about this rat business.

               The three crooks share a frightening laugh. We slowly ZOOM 
               INTO a CLOSEUP of the cop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

               We're inside the office of Joe Cabot. Joe's on the phone, 
               sitting behind his desk.

                                     JOE
                              (into phone)
                         Sid, I'm tellin' you don't worry 
                         about it. You had a bad couple of 
                         months, it happens.
                              (pause)
                         Sid, Sid, Sid... Stop, you're 
                         embarrassing me. I don't need to be 
                         told what I already know. When you 
                         have bad months, you do what every 
                         business man in the worlds does, I 
                         don't care if he's Donald Trump or 
                         Irving the tailor. Ya ride it out.

               There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

                                     JOE
                         Come in.

               One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps inside. 
               Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks towards 
               the man.

                                     TEDDY
                         Vic Vega's outside.

                                     JOE
                         Tell him to come in.

               Teddy leaves.

                                     JOE
                              (into phone)
                         Sid, a friend of mine's here. I gotta 
                         go.
                              (pause)
                         Good enough, bye.

               He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the front 
               of the desk.

               Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks 
               in.

               Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr. Blonde. 
               Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies style jacket.

               Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

               The two men embrace each other. Teddy leaves, closing the 
               door behind him.

                                     JOE
                         How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' 
                         good, ain't it?

                                     VIC
                         It's a change.

                                     JOE
                         Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?

                                     VIC
                         Sure.

                                     JOE
                         Take a seat.

               Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet. Vic sits in a chair set 
               in front of Joe's desk.

                                     JOE
                              (while he pours the 
                              drink)
                         Who's your parole officer?

                                     VIC
                         A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour 
                         Scagnetti.

                                     JOE
                         How is he?

                                     VIC
                         Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave 
                         the halfway house.

                                     JOE
                         Never ceases to amaze me. Fuckin' 
                         jungle bunny goes out there, slits 
                         some old woman's throat for twenty-
                         five cents. Fuckin' nigger gets Doris 
                         Day as a parole officer. But a good 
                         fella like you gets stuck with a 
                         ball-bustin' prick.

               Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic 
               swallows some Remy.

                                     VIC
                         I just want you to know, Joe, how 
                         much I appreciate your care packages 
                         on the inside.

                                     JOE
                         What the hell did you expect me to 
                         do? Just forget about you?

                                     VIC
                         I just wanted you to know, they meant 
                         a lot.

                                     JOE
                         It's the least I could do Vic. I 
                         wish I coulda done more.
                              (Joe flashes a side 
                              grin at Vic)
                         Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? 
                         What're your plans?

                                     VIC
                         Well, what I wanna do is go back to 
                         work. But I got this Scagnetti prick 
                         deep up my ass. He won't let me leave 
                         the halfway house till I get some 
                         piece of shit job. My plans have 
                         always been to be part of the team 
                         again.

               There's a KNOCK at the door.

                                     JOE
                         Come in.

               The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie. Vic 
               turns around in his seat and sees him.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Vic)
                         I see ya sittin here, but I don't 
                         believe it.

               Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

                                     EDDIE
                         How ya doin', Toothpick?

                                     VIC
                         Fine, now.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you 
                         up personally at the pen. This whole 
                         week's just been crazy. I've had my 
                         head up my ass the entire time.

                                     VIC
                         Funny you should mention it. That's 
                         what your father and I been talkin' 
                         about.

                                     EDDIE
                         That I should've picked you up?

                                     VIC
                         No. That your head's been up your 
                         ass. I walk through the door and Joe 
                         says "Vic, you're back, thank god. 
                         Finally somebody who knows what the 
                         fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, 
                         my son, is a fuck up." And I say 
                         "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." 
                         "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My 
                         son, I love him, but he's taking my 
                         business and flushing it down the 
                         fuckin' toilet! "
                              (to Joe)
                         I'm not tellin' tales out of school. 
                         You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.

                                     JOE
                         Eddie, I hate like hell for you to 
                         hear it this way. But when Vic asked 
                         me how's business, well, you don't 
                         lie to a man who's just done four 
                         years in the slammer for ya.

               Eddie bobs his head up and down.

                                     EDDIE
                         Oh really, is that a fact?

               Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

               The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle 
               on the floor of Joe's office.

               Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

                                     JOE
                              (yelling)
                         Okay, okay, enough, enough! Playtime's 
                         over! You wanna roll around on the 
                         floor, do it in Eddie's office, not 
                         mine!

               The two men break it up. They are completely disheveled, 
               hair a mess, shirttails out. As they get themselves together, 
               they continue to taunt one another.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, did ya see that?

                                     JOE
                         What?

                                     EDDIE
                         Guy got me on the ground, tried to 
                         fuck me.

                                     VIC
                         You fuckin' wish.

                                     EDDIE
                         You tried to fuck me in my father's 
                         office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, 
                         whatever you wanna do in the privacy 
                         of your own home, go do it. But don't 
                         try to fuck me. I don't think of you 
                         that way. I mean, I like you a lot -

                                     VIC
                         Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't 
                         throw you to the crew.

                                     EDDIE
                         No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four 
                         years fuckin' punks in the ass made 
                         you appreciate prime rib when you 
                         get it.

                                     VIC
                         I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd 
                         make you my dog's bitch. You'd be 
                         suckin' the dick and going down on a 
                         mangy T-bone hound.

                                     EDDIE
                         Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, 
                         walks into jail a white man, walks 
                         out talkin' like a nigger. It's all 
                         that black semen been shootin' up 
                         his butt. It's backed up into his 
                         brain and comes out of his mouth.

                                     JOE
                         Are you two finished? We were talkin' 
                         about some serious shit when you 
                         came in Eddie. We got a big problem 
                         we're tryin' to solve. Now Eddie, 
                         would you like to sit down and help 
                         us solve it, or do you two wanna 
                         piss fart around?

               Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it. So they both 
               take seats in front of Joe's desk.

                                     JOE
                         Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a 
                         parole problem.

                                     EDDIE
                         Really? Who's your P.O.?

                                     VIC
                         Seymour Scagnetti.

                                     EDDIE
                         Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a 
                         motherfucker.

                                     VIC
                         He is a motherfucker. He won't let 
                         me leave the halfway house till I 
                         get some piece of shit job.

                                     EDDIE
                         You're coming back to work for us, 
                         right?

                                     VIC
                         I wanna. But I gotta show this asshole 
                         I got an honest-to-goodness job before 
                         he'll let me move out on my own. I 
                         can't work for you guys and be worried 
                         about gettin' back before ten o'clock 
                         curfew.

                                     JOE
                              (to Eddie)
                         We can work this out, can't we?

                                     EDDIE
                         This isn't all that bad. We can give 
                         you a lot of legitimate jobs. Put 
                         you on the rotation at Long Beach as 
                         a dock worker.

                                     VIC
                         I don't wanna lift crates.

                                     EDDIE
                         You don't hafta lift shit. You don't 
                         really work there. But as far as the 
                         records are concerned, you do. I 
                         call up Matthews, the foreman, tell 
                         him he's got a new guy. You're on 
                         the schedule. You got a timecard, 
                         it's clocked in and out for you 
                         everyday, and you get a pay check at 
                         the end of the week. And ya know 
                         dock workers don't do too bad. So 
                         you can move into a halfway decent 
                         place without Scagnetti thinkin "what 
                         the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever 
                         wants to make a surprise visit, you're 
                         gone that day. That day we sent you 
                         to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit 
                         you needed to unload there. You're 
                         at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a 
                         bunch of shit and bringing it back. 
                         Part of your job is goin' different 
                         places - and we got places all over 
                         the place.

                                     JOE
                              (to Vic)
                         Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
                              (to Eddie)
                         Vic was worried.

                                     EDDIE
                         Me and you'll drive down to Long 
                         Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you 
                         to Matthews, tell him what's going 
                         on.

                                     VIC
                         That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
                              (pause)
                         When do you think you'll need me for 
                         real work?

                                     JOE
                         Well, it's kinda a strange time right 
                         now. Things are kinda -

                                     EDDIE
                         Nuts. We got a big meeting in Vegas 
                         coming up. And we're kinda just gettin 
                         ready for that right now.

                                     JOE
                         Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. 
                         Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti 
                         fuck off your back, and we'll be 
                         talking to ya.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear 
                         it out. I know you don't like to use 
                         any of the boys on these jobs, but 
                         technically, Vic ain't one of the 
                         boys. He's been gone for four years. 
                         He ain't on no one's list. Ya know 
                         he can handle himself, ya know you 
                         can trust him.

               Joe looks at Vic.

               Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

                                     JOE
                         How would you feel about pullin' a 
                         heist with about five other guys?

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his 
               portable car phone. The sounds of the seventies are coming 
               out of his car radio in the form of "LOVE GOES WHERE MY 
               ROSEMARY GOES" by Edison Lighthouse.

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         Hey Dov, we got a major situation 
                         here.
                              (pause)
                         I know you know that. I gotta talk 
                         with daddy and find out what he wants 
                         done.

               FLASH ON

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed 
               behind his back. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde surround 
               him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. "LOVE GROWS..." 
               PLAYS over the soundtrack.

               BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         All I know is what Vic told me. He 
                         said the place turned into a fuckin' 
                         bullet festival. He took a cop as 
                         hostage, just to get the fuck out of 
                         there.

               FLASH ON

               WAREHOUSE

               The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.

               BACK TO EDDIE

                                     EDDIE
                              (into phone)
                         Do I sound like I'm jokin'? He's 
                         fuckin' driving around with the cop 
                         in his trunk.
                              (pause)
                         I don't know who did that. I don't 
                         know who has the loot, if anybody 
                         has the loot. Who's dead, who's alive, 
                         who's caught, who's not... I will 
                         know, I'm practically there. But 
                         what do I tell these guys about daddy?
                              (pause)
                         You sure that's what he said?
                              (pause)
                         Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside 
               the warehouse.

               Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse. He gets out of the 
               car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to himself)
                         Fucking assholes.

               Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open, and 
               steps inside the warehouse.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still WAILING 
               on him.

               Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

                                     EDDIE
                         What in Sam Hill is goin' on?

               Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

                         MR. PINK
                 Hey, Nice Guy, we got 
                 a -

                                                       MR WHITE
                                               You askin' what's goin' 
                                               on? Where the fuck is Joe?

               Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

                                     EDDIE
                         Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!

                                     MR. WHITE
                         No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on 
                         us if we don't get him taken care 
                         of.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were set up, the cops were waiting 
                         for us.

                                     EDDIE
                         What? Nobody set anybody up.

                                     MR. PINK
                         The cops were there waitin' for us!

                                     EDDIE
                         Bullshit.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, 
                         we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the 
                         cops had that store staked out.

                                     EDDIE
                         Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

                                     MR. PINK
                         What the fuck d'you think we've been 
                         askin' each other?

                                     EDDIE
                         And what are your answers? Was it 
                         me? You think I set you up?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I don't know, but somebody did.

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody did. You assholes turn the 
                         jewelry store into a wild west show, 
                         and you wonder why cops show up.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Where's Joseph?

                                     EDDIE
                         I ain't talked to him. I talked to 
                         Dov. Dov said he's comin' out here, 
                         and he's fucking pissed.

                                     MR. PINK
                              (to Mr. White)
                         I told ya he'd be pissed.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         What are you gonna do about him?

                                     EDDIE
                         Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance 
                         to breathe. I got a few questions of 
                         my own, ya know.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         You ain't dying, he is.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'll call somebody.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who?

                                     EDDIE
                         A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you 
                         think. I'll call a doctor, take care 
                         of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's 
                         Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Brown's dead, we don't know about 
                         Blue.

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Well, he's either dead or he's alive 
                         or the cops got him or they don't.

               DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

                                     EDDIE (O.S.)
                         I take it this is the bastard you 
                         told me about.
                              (referring to the cop)
                         Why the hell are you beating on him?

                                     MR. PINK
                         So he'll tell us who the fuck set us 
                         up.

                                     EDDIE
                         Would you stop it with that shit! 
                         You beat on this prick enough, he'll 
                         tell ya he started the Chicago fire. 
                         That don't necessarily make it so. 
                         Okay, first things fucking last, 
                         where's the shit? Please tell me 
                         somebody brought something with them.

                                     MR. PINK
                         I got a bag. I stashed it till I 
                         could be sure this place wasn't a 
                         police station.

                                     EDDIE
                         Well, let's go get it. We also gotta 
                         get rid of all those cars. It looks 
                         like Sam's hot car lot outside.
                              (pointing to Mr. Blonde)
                         You stay here and babysit Orange and 
                         the cop.
                              (referring to Mr. 
                              Pink and Mr. White)
                         You two take a car each, I'll follow 
                         ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, 
                         then we'll pick up the stones. And 
                         while I'm following you, I'll arrange 
                         for some sort of a doctor for our 
                         friend.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         We can't leave these guys with him.

               Meaning Mr. Blonde.

                                     EDDIE
                         Why not?

               Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Because this guy's a fucking psycho. 
                         And if you think Joe's pissed at us, 
                         that ain't nothing compared to how 
                         pissed off I am at him, for puttin' 
                         me in the same room as this bastard.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                              (to Eddie)
                         You see what I been puttin' up with? 
                         As soon as I walk through the door 
                         I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm 
                         what you told me about us stayin' 
                         put and Mr. White whips out his gun, 
                         sticks it in my face, and starts 
                         screaming "You motherfucker, I'm 
                         gonna blow you away, blah, blah, 
                         blah."

                                     MR. WHITE
                         He's the reason the place turned 
                         into a shooting gallery.
                              (to Mr. Pink)
                         What are you, a silent partner? 
                         Fuckin' tell him.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He seems all right now, but he went 
                         crazy in the store.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         This is what he was doin'.

               Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the store.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         I told 'em not to touch the alarm. 
                         They touched it. I blew 'em full of 
                         holes. If they hadn't done what I 
                         told 'em not it, they'd still be 
                         alive.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         That's your excuse for going on a 
                         kill crazy rampage?

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         I don't like alarms.

                                     EDDIE
                         What does it matter who stays with 
                         the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. 
                         Not after he's seen everybody. You 
                         should've never took him outta your 
                         trunk in the first place.

                                     MR. PINK
                         We were trying to find out what he 
                         knew about the set up.

                                     EDDIE
                         There is no fuckin' set up!
                              (Eddie takes charge)
                         Look, this is the news. Blondie, you 
                         stay here and take care of them two. 
                         White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if 
                         Joe gets here and sees all those 
                         fucking cars parked out front, he's 
                         going to be as mad at me as he is at 
                         you.

               Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse 
               talking amongst themselves.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

               Mr. Blonde closes the door after them. He then slowly turns 
               his head towards the cop.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Alone at last.

               CLOSEUP - COP'S FACE

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Now where were we?

                                     COP
                         I told you I don't know anything 
                         about any fucking set up. I've only 
                         been on the force eight months, nobody 
                         tells me anything! I don't know 
                         anything! You can torture me if you 
                         want -

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Thanks, don't mind if I do.

                                     COP
                         Your boss even said there wasn't a 
                         set up.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         First off, I don't have a boss. Are 
                         you clear about that?

               He SLAPS the cop's face.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         I asked you a question. Are you clear 
                         about that?

                                     COP
                         Yes.

                                     MR. BLONDE (O.S.)
                         Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I 
                         don't really care about what you 
                         know or don't know. I'm gonna torture 
                         you for awhile regardless. Not to 
                         get information, but because torturing 
                         a cop amuses me. There's nothing you 
                         can say, I've heard it all before. 
                         There's nothing you can do. Except 
                         pray for a quick death, which you 
                         ain't gonna get.

               He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.

               COP'S POV

               Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S "super 
                         sounds of the seventies" weekend.

               He turns on the radio.

               Stealer's Wheel's hit "STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU" PLAYS 
               over the speaker.

               NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

               Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. He opens a razor.

               Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, holding 
               the razor, singing along with the song.

               Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

               A SLASH across the face.

               The cop / camera moves around wildly.

               Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's / our face, singing 
               along with the seventies hit.

               Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's / our ear.

               The cop / camera moves around wildly.

               Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop / us to see.

               INT. / EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

               We follow Mr. Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse... to 
               his car. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of 
               gasoline.

               He walks back inside the warehouse...

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               ...carrying the can of gas.

               Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING 
               him not to do this.

               Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

               Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

                                     MR. BLONDE
                         "Clowns to the left of me, Jokers to 
                         the right. Here I am, stuck in the 
                         middle with you."

               He moves the match up to the cop...

               ...when a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

               The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the bloody 
               Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

               We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET HITS 
               and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

               Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

               Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody trail 
               behind him.

               When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (feebly)
                         What's your name?

                                     COP
                         Marvin.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Marvin what?

                                     COP
                         Marvin Nash.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Listen to me, Marvin Nash. I'm a 
                         cop.

                                     MARVIN
                         I know.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (surprised)
                         You do?

                                     MARVIN
                         Your name's Freddy something.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Freddy Newendyke.

                                     MARVIN
                         Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, 
                         about five months ago.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Shit. I don't remember that at all.

                                     MARVIN
                         I do.
                              (pause)
                         How do I look?

               The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and 
               the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I don't know what to tell you Marvin.

               Marvin starts to weep.

                                     MARVIN
                         That fucking bastard! That fucking 
                         sick fucking bastard!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's 
                         officers positioned and waiting to 
                         move in a block away.

                                     MARVIN
                              (screaming)
                         What the fuck are they waiting for? 
                         That motherfucker cut off my ear! He 
                         slashed my face! I'm deformed!

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         And I'm dying. They don't know that. 
                         All they know is they're not to make 
                         a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I 
                         was sent undercover to get Cabot. 
                         You heard 'em, they said he's on his 
                         way. Don't pussy out on me now, 
                         Marvin. We're just gonna sit here 
                         and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his 
                         fuckin' head through that door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD:

                                       "MR. ORANGE"

               INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a Malcom 
               X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star on it, and 
               a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny bacon, cheese and 
               avocado burger. He sits in a booth all alone. He's waiting 
               for somebody. As he waits, he practically empties an entire 
               bottle of ketchup on his french fries, not by mistake either - 
               that's just how he likes it.

               We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing a 
               high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot 
               Holdaway, and head his way. Holdaway sees Freddy bop towards 
               him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered across his face.

               CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway. 
               We hear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                                     FREDDY (O.S.)
                         Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's 
                         inside. Cabot's doing a job and take 
                         a big fat guess who he wants on the 
                         team?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         This better not be some Freddy joke.

               LOW ANGLE looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

                                     FREDDY
                         It ain't no joke, I'm in there. I'm 
                         up his ass.

               CLOSEUP - HOLDAWAY

               Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Congratulations.

               EXT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide 
               into the booth across from Holdaway. Freddy's doing a lot of 
               talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.

               INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

               FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

               We are frozen on a MEDIUM CLOSEUP of Holdaway listening to 
               Freddy. We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

                                     FREDDY (O.S.)
                         Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to 
                         meet me. He says I should just hang 
                         around my apartment and wait for a 
                         phone call. Well after waiting three 
                         goddamn days by the fuckin' phone, 
                         he calls me last night and says Joe's 
                         ready, and he'll pick me up in fifteen 
                         minutes.

               The freeze frame ENDS. Holdaway comes suddenly up to speed 
               and says:

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Who all picked you up?

               From here to end we cut back and forth.

                                     FREDDY
                         Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         ...What bar?

                                     FREDDY
                         The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When 
                         we got there, I met Joe and a guy 
                         named Mr. White. It's a phony name. 
                         My name's Mr. Orange.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         You ever seen this motherfucker 
                         before?

                                     FREDDY
                         Who, Mr. White?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Yeah.

                                     FREDDY
                         No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one 
                         of Cabot's soldiers either. He's 
                         gotta be from outta town. But Joe 
                         knows him real well.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         How can you tell?

                                     FREDDY
                         The way they talk to each other. You 
                         can tell they're buddies.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Did the two of you talk?

                                     FREDDY
                         Me and Mr. White?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Yeah.

                                     FREDDY
                         A little.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         What about?

                                     FREDDY
                         The Brewers.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         The Milwaukee Brewers?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yeah. They had just won the night 
                         before, and he made a killing off 
                         'em.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, 
                         his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. 
                         And I'll bet you everything from a 
                         diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I-
                         know, that in Milwaukee they got a 
                         sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's 
                         ass. I want you to go through the 
                         mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with 
                         a history of armed robbery, and put 
                         a name to that face.

               Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                              (with his mouth full)
                         What kinds questions did Cabot ask?

                                     FREDDY
                         Where I was from, who I knew, how I 
                         knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit 
                         like that.

               Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now. He 
               motions for Freddy to elaborate.

                                     FREDDY
                         He asked me if I ever done armed 
                         robbery before. I read him my credits. 
                         I robbed a few gas and sips, sold 
                         some weed, told him recently I held 
                         the shotgun while me and another guy 
                         pulled down a poker game in Portland.

               CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CLOSEUP.

                                     HOLDAWAY(O.S.)
                         Didja use the commode story?

                                     FREDDY
                         Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

               Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous. Holdaway 
               wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt. Freddy sits on one 
               of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket, looking at 
               pieces of paper stapled together.

                                     FREDDY
                         What's this?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's a scene. Memorize it.

                                     FREDDY
                         What?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         A undercover cop has got to be Marlon 
                         Brando. To do this job you got to be 
                         a great actor. You got to be 
                         naturalistic. You got to be 
                         naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a 
                         great actor you're a bad actor, and 
                         bad acting is bullshit in this job.

                                     FREDDY
                              (referring to the 
                              papers)
                         But what is this?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's a amusing anecdote about a drug 
                         deal.

                                     FREDDY
                         What?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         Something funny that happened to you 
                         while you were doing a job.

                                     FREDDY
                         I gotta memorize all this shit?

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         It's like a joke. You remember what's 
                         important, and the rest you make 
                         your own. The only way to make it 
                         your own is to keep sayin' it, and 
                         sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' 
                         it, and sayin' it.

                                     FREDDY
                         I can do that.

                                     HOLDAWAY
                         The things you gotta remember are 
                         the details. It's the details that 
                         sell your story. Now this story takes 
                         place in this men's room. So you 
                         gotta know the details about this 
                         men's room. You gotta know they got 
                         a blower instead of a towel to dry 
                         your hands. You gotta know the stalls 
                         ain't got no doors. You gotta know 
                         whether they got liquid or powdered 
                         soap, whether they got hot water or 
                         not, 'cause if you do your job when 
                         you tell your story, everybody should 
                         believe it. And if you tell your 
                         story to somebody who's actually 
                         taken a piss in this men's room, and 
                         you get one detail they remember 
                         right, they'll swear by you.

               INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing 
               the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still 
               reading it from the page, and every once in a while he 
               stumbles over his words.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...this was during the Los Angeles 
                         marijuana drought of '86. I still 
                         had a connection. Which was insane, 
                         'cause you couldn't get weed any 
                         fuckin' where then. Anyway, I had a 
                         connection with this hippie chick up 
                         in Santa Cruz. All and my friends 
                         knew it. And they'd give me a call 
                         and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin' 
                         some, you think you could buy me 
                         some too?" They knew I smoked, so 
                         they'd ask me to buy a little for 
                         them when I was buyin'. But it got 
                         to be every time I bought some weed, 
                         I was buyin' for four or five 
                         different people. Finally I said, 
                         "Fuck this shit." I'm makin' this 
                         bitch rich. She didn't have to do 
                         jack shit, she never even had to 
                         meet these people. I was fuckin' 
                         doin' all the work. So I got together 
                         with her and told her, "Hey, I'm 
                         sick of this shit. I'm comin' through 
                         for everybody, and nobody's comin' 
                         through for me. So, either I'm gonna 
                         tell all my friends to find their 
                         own source, or you give me a bunch 
                         of weed, I'll sell it to them, give 
                         you the money, minus ten percent, 
                         and I get my pot for free." So, I 
                         did if for awhile...

               FREDDY EXITS FRAME

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Another empty frame, except obviously outside. Freddy enters 
               frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, 
               finishing his sentence. When we move to a wider shot we see 
               Freddy performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking 
               lot. Holdaway sits on the hood of his beat-up car. Freddy 
               paces back and forth as he performs his story.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...but then that got to be a pain in 
                         the ass. People called me on the 
                         phone all the fuckin' time. I couldn't 
                         rent a fuckin' tape without six phone 
                         calls interrupting me. "Hey, Freddy, 
                         when's the next time you're gettin' 
                         some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin' to 
                         watch 'Lost Boys' - when I have some, 
                         I'll let you know." And then these 
                         rinky-dink pot heads come by - there's 
                         my friends and everything, but still. 
                         I got all my shit laid out in sixty 
                         dollar bags. Well, they don't want 
                         sixty dollars worth. They want ten 
                         dollars worth. Breaking it up is a 
                         major fuckin' pain in the ass. I 
                         don't even know how much ten dollars 
                         worth is. "Well, fuck, man, I don't 
                         want that much around. If I have 
                         that much around I'll smoke it." 
                         "Hey, if you guys can't control your 
                         smokin, that's not my problem. You 
                         motherfuckers been smokin' for five 
                         years, be a adult about it." Finally 
                         I just told my connection, count me 
                         out. But as it turns out, I'm the 
                         best guy she had, and she depended a 
                         lot on my business. But I was still 
                         sick to death of it. And she's trying 
                         to talk me into not quitin'. Now 
                         this was a very weird situation, 
                         'cause I don't know if you remember 
                         back in '86, there was a major fuckin' 
                         drought. Nobody and anything. People 
                         were livin' on resin and smokin' the 
                         wood in their pipes for months. And 
                         this chick had a bunch, and was 
                         beggin' me to sell it. So I told her 
                         I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man 
                         anymore. But I would take a little 
                         bit and sell it to my close, close, 
                         close friends. She agreed to that, 
                         and said we'd keep the same 
                         arrangement as before, ten percent 
                         and free pot for me, as long as I 
                         helped her out that weekend. She had 
                         a brick of weed she was sellin', and 
                         she didn't want to go to the buy 
                         alone...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

               Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a 
               table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy continues his story. 
               The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...Her brother usually goes with 
                         her, but he's in county unexpectedly.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What for?

                                     FREDDY
                         Traffic tickets gone to warrant. 
                         They stopped him for something, found 
                         the warrants on 'im, took 'im to 
                         jail. She doesn't want to walk around 
                         alone with all that weed. Well, I 
                         don't wanna do this, I have a bad 
                         feeling about it, but she keeps askin' 
                         me, keeps askin' me, finally I said 
                         okay 'cause I'm sick of listening to 
                         it. Well, we're picking this guy up 
                         at the train station.

                                     JOE
                         You're picking the buyer up at the 
                         train station? You're carrying the 
                         weed on you?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yeah, the guy needed it right away. 
                         Don't ask me why. So we get to the 
                         train station, and we're waitin' for 
                         the guy. Now I'm carrying the weed 
                         in one of those carry-on bags, and I 
                         gotta take a piss. So I tell the 
                         connection I'll be right back, I'm 
                         goin' to the little boys room...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

               MEDIUM ON FREDDY

               He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his 
               shoulder. Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks. We move 
               into a CLOSEUP.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         ...So I walk into the men's room, 
                         and who's standing there?

               FREEZE FRAME on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles 
               County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes 
               are on Freddy. Everyone is frozen.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         ...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs 
                         and a German Shepherd.

                                     NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
                         They were waiting for you?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         No. They were just a bunch of cops 
                         hangin' out in the men's room, 
                         talkin'. When I walked through the 
                         door they all stopped what they were 
                         talking about and looked at me.

                         That's hard, man. That's a fuckin' 
                         hard situation.

               BACK TO MEN'S ROOM

               EXTREME CLOSEUP ON GERMAN SHEPHERD

               Barking his head off.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         The German Shepherd starts barkin'. 
                         He's barkin' at me. I mean it's 
                         obvious he's barkin' at me.

               We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. We can 
               hear the dog barking.

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Every nerve ending, all of my senses, 
                         the blood in my veins, everything I 
                         has was screaming, "Take off, man, 
                         just take off, get the fuck outta 
                         there! "Panic hit me like a bucket 
                         of water. First there was the shock 
                         of it - BAM, right in the face! Then 
                         I'm just standin' there drenched in 
                         panic. And all those sheriffs are 
                         lookin' at me and they know. They 
                         can smell it. As sure as that fuckin' 
                         dog can, they can smell it on me.

               FREEZE FRAME

               Freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in front of the sheriffs. 
               It suddenly jerks to life, and moves to speed. The dog is 
               barking. Freddy moves to his right, out of frame. We stay on 
               the sheriffs. One sheriff yells at the dog.

                                     SHERIFF #1
                         Shut up!

               The dog quiets down. Sheriff #2 continues with his story. A 
               couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but 
               as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.

                                     SHERIFF #2
                         So my gun's drawn, right? I got it 
                         aimed right at him. I tell 'em, 
                         "Freeze, don't fuckin' move." And 
                         the little idiot's lookin' at me, 
                         nodding his head "Yes," sayin' "I 
                         know... I know... I know." Meanwhile 
                         his right hand is creepin' towards 
                         his glove box. So I scream at him, 
                         "Asshole, you better fuckin' freeze 
                         right now! " And he's still lookin' 
                         right at me, saying "I know... I 
                         know... I know." And his right hand's 
                         still going for the glove box.

               THE CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against 
               the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

                                     SHERIFF #2 (O.S.)
                         I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna shoot 
                         you in the face right now if you 
                         don't put your hands on the fuckin' 
                         dash." And the guy's girlfriend, a 
                         real sexy Oriental bitch, starts 
                         screamin' at him, "Chuck, are you 
                         out of your mind? Put your hands on 
                         the dash like the officer said." And 
                         then like nothing, the guy snaps out 
                         of it and casually puts his hands on 
                         the dash.

               Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the 
               sheriffs over to the sink.

               THE CAMERA PANS with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink. He 
               looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands.

                                     SHERIFF #1
                         What was he goin' for?

                                     SHERIFF #2
                         His registration. Stupid fuckin' 
                         citizen, doesn't have the slightest 
                         idea how close he came to gettin' 
                         shot.

               Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but 
               there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on the 
               drying machine. He can't hear anything the sheriffs say now. 
               The sound of the machine dominates the sound track.

               These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

               We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone. 
               Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

               The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment 
               getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket and slips 
               on some sneakers.

               DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand comes 
               into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE UP to his 
               face.

               Fear.

                         every word, cuz you're super cool.

               He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and close

                                     COP #1 (O.S.)
                         There goes our boy.

                                     COP #2 (O.S.)
                         I swear, a guy has to have rocks in 
                         his head the size of Gibraltar to 
                         work undercover.

                                     COP #1 (O.S.)
                         Do you want one of these?

                                     COP #2 (O.S.)
                         Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

               Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

               Cop #1 starts the engine and follows.

               INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the 
               passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat 
               together.

                                     MR. PINK
                         ...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, 
                         black women ain't the same as white 
                         women.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (sarcastically)
                         There's a slight difference.

               The car laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Go ahead and laugh, you know what I 
                         mean. What a while bitch will put up 
                         with, a black bitch won't put up 
                         with for a minute. They got a line, 
                         and if you cross it, they fuck you 
                         up.

                                     EDDIE
                         I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on 
                         this. I've seen it happen.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a 
                         truism, how come every nigger I know 
                         treats his woman like a piece of 
                         shit?

                                     MR. PINK
                         I'll make you a bet that those same 
                         damn niggers who were showin' their 
                         ass in public, when their bitches 
                         get 'em home, they chill the fuck 
                         out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Not these guys.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, those guys too.

                                     EDDIE
                         Let me tell you guys a story. In one 
                         of daddy's clubs there was this black 
                         cocktail waitress named Elois.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Elois?

                                     EDDIE
                         Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called 
                         her Lady E.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Where was she from, Compton?

                                     EDDIE
                         No. She was from Ladora Heights.

                                     MR. PINK
                         The black Beverly Hills. I knew this 
                         lady from Ladora Heights once.
                              (in a stuck up black 
                              female voice)
                         "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's 
                         the black Beverly Hills."

                                     EDDIE
                         It's not the black Beverly Hills, 
                         it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, 
                         this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-
                         upper. I bet every guy who's ever 
                         met her has jacked off to her at 
                         least once. You know who she looked 
                         like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV 
                         show "Get Christie Love"? She was a 
                         black female cop. She always used to 
                         say "You're under arrest, sugar."

                                     MR. PINK
                         I was in the sixth grade when that 
                         show was on. I totally dug it. What 
                         the fuck was the name of the chick 
                         who played Christie Love?

                                     EDDIE
                         Pam Grier.

                                     MR. PINK
                         No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier 
                         was the other one. Pam Grier made 
                         the movies. Christie Love was like a 
                         Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.

                                     MR. PINK
                         What the fuck was that chick's name? 
                         Oh this is just great, I'm totally 
                         fuckin' tortured now.

                                     EDDIE
                         Well, whoever she was, Elois looked 
                         like her. So one night I walk into 
                         the club, and no Elois. Now the 
                         bartender was a wetback, he was a 
                         friend of mine, his name was Carlos. 
                         So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's 
                         Lady E tonight?" Well apparently 
                         Lady E was married to this real piece 
                         of dog shit. I mean a real animal. 
                         And apparently he would so things to 
                         her.

                                     FREDDY
                         Do things? What would he do? You 
                         mean like beat her up?

                                     EDDIE
                         Nobody knows for sure what he did. 
                         We just know he did something. Anyway, 
                         Elois plays it real cool. And waits 
                         for the next time this bag of shit 
                         gets drunk. So one night the guy 
                         gets drunk and passes out on the 
                         couch. So while the guy's inebriated, 
                         she strips him naked. Then she takes 
                         some crazy glue and glues his dick 
                         to his belly.

               The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

                                     EDDIE
                         I'm dead fuckin' serious. She put 
                         some on his dick and some on his 
                         belly, then stuck 'em together. The 
                         paramedics had to come and cut it 
                         loose.

               The car reacts badly.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     FREDDY
                         You can do some crazy things with 
                         it.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't know what he did to her, but 
                         she got even.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Was he all pissed off?

                                     MR. PINK
                         How would you feel if you had to do 
                         a handstand every time you took a 
                         piss.

               The car laughs.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

                                     JOE
                         You guys like to tell jokes and giggle 
                         and kid around, huh? Giggling like a 
                         bunch of young broads in a school 
                         yard. Well, let me tell a joke.

               CAMERA TRACKS ACROSS men's faces.

                                     JOE
                         Five guys sitting in a bull pen, San 
                         Quentin. Wondering how the fuck they 
                         got there. What'd we wrong? What 
                         should we've done? What didn't we 
                         do? It's your fault, my fault, his 
                         fault. All that bullshit. Finally, 
                         someone comes up with the idea, wait 
                         a minute, while we were planning 
                         this caper, all we did was sit around 
                         and tell fuckin' jokes. Got the 
                         message? When this caper's over, and 
                         I'm sure it's gonna be a successful 
                         one, hell, we'll go down to the 
                         Hawaiian Island and I'll roar and 
                         laugh with all of you. You'll find 
                         me a different character down there. 
                         Right now it's a matter of business. 
                         With the exception of Eddie and 
                         myself, who you already know, you'll 
                         be using aliases. Under no 
                         circumstances are you to tell one 
                         another your real name or anything 
                         else about yourself. That includes 
                         where you're from, your wife's name, 
                         where you might've done time, about 
                         a bank in St. Petersburg you might've 
                         robbed. You guys don't say shit about 
                         who you are, where you been or what 
                         you've done. Only thing you guys can 
                         talk about is what you're going to 
                         do. This way the only ones who know 
                         who the members of the team are Eddie 
                         and myself. And that's the way I 
                         like it. Because in the unlikely 
                         event of one of you getting 
                         apprehended by the cops, not that I 
                         expect that to happen - it most 
                         definitely should not happen - it 
                         hasn't happened, you don't have 
                         anything to deal with. You don't 
                         know any names. You know my name, 
                         you know Eddie's name. That I don't 
                         care about. You gotta prove it. I 
                         ain't worried. Besides, this way you 
                         gotta trust me. I like that. I set 
                         this up and picked the men I wanted 
                         for it. None of you came to me, I 
                         approached all of you. I know you. I 
                         know your work, I know your 
                         reputation. I know you as men. Except 
                         for this guy.

               Joe points a finger at Freddy.

               Freddy shits a brick.

                                     JOE
                         But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he 
                         wouldn't be here. Okay, let me 
                         introduce everybody to everybody. 
                         But once again, at the risk of being 
                         redundant, if I even think I hear 
                         somebody telling or referring to 
                         somebody by their Christian name...
                              (Joe searches for the 
                              right words)
                         ...you won't want to be you. Okay, 
                         quickly.
                              (pointing at the men 
                              as he gives them a 
                              name)
                         Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, 
                         Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why am I Mr. Pink?

                                     JOE
                         Cause you're a faggot, alright?

               Everybody laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Why can't we pick out our own colors?

                                     JOE
                         I tried that once, it don't work. 
                         You get four guys fighting over who's 
                         gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody 
                         knows anybody else, nobody wants to 
                         back down. So forget it, I pick. Be 
                         thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Yeah, but Mr. Brown? That's too close 
                         to Mr. Shit.

               Everybody laughs.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. 
                         Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. 
                         That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. 
                         Purple.

                                     JOE
                         You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from 
                         another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. 
                         Pink.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Who cares what your name is? Who 
                         cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, 
                         Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

                                     MR. PINK
                         Oh that's really easy for you to 
                         say, you're Mr. White. You gotta 
                         cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. 
                         White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no 
                         big deal, you wanna trade?

                                     JOE
                         Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, 
                         this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city 
                         counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. 
                         We got two ways here, my way or the 
                         highway. And you can go down either 
                         of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. 
                         Pink?

                                     MR. PINK
                         Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget 
                         it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, 
                         let's move on.

               CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the 
               layout of the jewelry store on it.

                                     JOE
                         I'll move on, when I feel like it. 
                         All you guys got the goddamn message? 
                         I'm so goddamn mad I can hardly talk. 
                         Let's go to work.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

               We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

               CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on customers 
               through the windows.

               While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White 
               and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Let's go over it. Where are you?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         I stand outside and guard the door. 
                         I don't let anybody come in or go 
                         out.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Brown?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's 
                         parked across the street till I give 
                         him the signal, then he pulls up in 
                         front of the store.

                                     MR. WHITE (V.O.)
                         Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

                                     FREDDY (V.O.)
                         Crowd control. They handle customers 
                         and employees in the display area.

               INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

               Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street 
               from the jewelry store, staking it out.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Myself and Mr. Pink?

                                     FREDDY
                         You two take the manager in the back 
                         and make him give you the diamonds. 
                         We're there for those stones, period. 
                         Since no display cases are being 
                         fucked with, no alarms should go 
                         off. We're out of there in two 
                         minutes, not one second longer. What 
                         if the manager won't give up the 
                         diamonds?

                                     MR. WHITE
                         When you're dealing with a store 
                         like this, they're insured up the 
                         ass. They're not supposed to give 
                         you and resistance whatsoever. If 
                         you get a customer or an employee 
                         who thinks he's Charles Bronson, 
                         take the butt of your gun and smash 
                         their nose in. Drops 'em right to 
                         the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls 
                         down, screaming, blood squirts out 
                         his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody 
                         says fuckin' shit after that. You 
                         might get some bitch talk shit to 
                         ya. But give her a look, like you're 
                         gonna smash her in the face next. 
                         Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if 
                         it's a manager, that's a different 
                         story. The managers know better than 
                         to fuck around. So if one's givin' 
                         you static, he probably thinks he's 
                         a real cowboy. So what you gotta do 
                         is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. 
                         If you wanna know something and he 
                         won't tell you, cut off one of his 
                         fingers. The little one. Then you 
                         tell 'im his thumb's next. After 
                         that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies 
                         underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a 
                         taco.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.

               In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns FIRING, 
               people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass 
               BREAKING...

               A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

               The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

               Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING Mr. 
               Brown FALLS out.

                                     MR. BROWN
                              (screaming)
                         My eyes! My eyes! I'm blind, I'm 
                         fucking blind!

                                     FREDDY
                         You're not blind, there's just blood 
                         in your eyes.

               Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics. He RUNS to the end 
               of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

               FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the patrol 
               car.

               Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr. White's 
               ambush in shock.

               Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

                                     MR. BROWN
                         Mr. Orange? You're Mr. Orange, aren't 
                         you?

               By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown is 
               dead.

               Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Is he dead?

               Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Did he did or not?

               Freddy, scared.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         What? Snap out of it!

               Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as he 
               RUNS.

               They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

               A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

               Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car. He points his 
               gun at her.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Get us outta here!

               Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

               Freddy starts to climb in.

               The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         The bitch's got a gun!

               She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

               On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the 
               face.

               CLOSEUP - FREDDY

               As he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened to him 
               and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.

               Mr. White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He 
               SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.

               INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is CRYING.

               We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the 
               getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

                                     MR. WHITE (O.S.)
                         Just hold on buddy boy.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed 
                         me...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. 
               Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.

               We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot 
               full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody 
               mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound. 
               Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.

                                     EDDIE
                         What the fuck happened here?

               Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde / Toothpick Vic.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         What happened?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (very weakly)
                         Blonde went crazy. He slashed the 
                         cop's face, cut off his ear and was 
                         gonna burn him alive.

                                     EDDIE
                              (yelling)
                         Who cares what he was gonna do to 
                         this fuckin' pig?

               Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and the 
               chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once 
               more.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         You were saying he went crazy? 
                         Something like that? Worse or better?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Look, Eddie, he was pullin' a burn. 
                         He was gonna kill the cop and me. 
                         And when you guys walked through the 
                         door, he was gonna blow you to hell 
                         and make off with the diamonds.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Eddie)
                         Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That 
                         sick piece of shit was a stone cold 
                         psycho.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                              (to Eddie)
                         You could've asked the cop, if you 
                         didn't just kill him. He talked about 
                         what he was going to do when he was 
                         slicing him up.

                                     EDDIE
                         I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         It makes perfect fuckin' sense to 
                         me. Eddie, you didn't see how he 
                         acted during the job, we did.

               Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

                                     MR. PINK
                         He's right about the ear, it's hacked 
                         off.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Mr. Orange)
                         Let me say this out loud, just to 
                         get it straight in my mind. According 
                         to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill 
                         you. Then when we came back, kill 
                         us, grab the diamonds, and scram. 
                         That's your story? I'm correct about 
                         that, right?

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         Eddie, you can believe me or not 
                         believe me, but it's the truth. I 
                         swear on my mother's eternal soul 
                         that's what happened.

               The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of Nice Guy Eddie.

               There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has 
               said. Finally:

                                     EDDIE
                         The man you killed was just released 
                         from prison. He got caught at a 
                         company warehouse full of hot items. 
                         He could've walked away. All he had 
                         to do was say my dad's name. But 
                         instead he shut his mouth and did 
                         his time. He did four years for us, 
                         and he did 'em like a man. And we 
                         were very grateful. So, Mr. Orange, 
                         you're tellin' me this very good 
                         friend of mine, who did four years 
                         for my father, who in four years 
                         never made a deal, no matter what 
                         they dangled in front of him, you're 
                         telling me that now, that now this 
                         man is free, and we're making good 
                         on our commitment to him, he's just 
                         gonna decide, right out of the fuckin' 
                         blue, to rip us off?

               Silence.

                                     EDDIE
                         Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me 
                         what really happened?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Why? It'll just be more bullshit.

               Eddie steps out of his CLOSEUP and we see Joe Cabot standing 
               in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

                                     JOE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         This man set us up.

               CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's 
                         happening.

                                     JOE
                         That's okay, Eddie, I do.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (to Joe)
                         What the fuck are you talking about?

                                     JOE
                              (pointing to Mr. Orange)
                         That piece of shit. Workin' with the 
                         cops.

                                     MR. WHITE, MR. PINK & EDDIE
                         What?

                                     JOE
                         I said this lump of shit is workin' 
                         with the LAPD.

               MR. ORANGE'S POV

               Looking up from the floor at everybody.

               Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

                                     JOE
                         Aren't you?

                                     MR. ORANGE (O.S.)
                         I don't have the slightest fuckin' 
                         idea what you're talkin' about.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (very calmly to Joe)
                         Joe, I don't know what you think you 
                         know, but you're wrong.

                                     JOE
                         Like hell I am.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (very calmly)
                         Joe, trust me on this, you've made a 
                         mistake. He's a good kid. I understand 
                         you're hot, you're super-fuckin' 
                         pissed. We're all real emotional. 
                         But you're barking up the wrong tree. 
                         I know this man, and he wouldn't do 
                         that.

                                     JOE
                         You don't know jack shit. I do. This 
                         rotten bastard tipped off the cops 
                         and got Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue killed.

                                     MR. PINK
                         Mr. Blue's dead?

                                     JOE
                         Dead as Dillinger.

                                     EDDIE
                         The motherfucker killed Vic.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         How do you know all this?

                                     JOE
                         He was the only one I wasn't a hundred 
                         percent on. I should have my fucking 
                         head examined for goin' forward when 
                         I wasn't a hundred percent. But he 
                         seemed like a good kid, and I was 
                         impatient and greedy and all the 
                         things that fuck you up.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (screaming)
                         That's your proof?

                                     JOE
                         You don't need proof when you got 
                         instinct. I ignored it before, but 
                         not no more.

               He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

               Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

               Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms.

               Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

                                     EDDIE
                         Have you lost your fucking mind? Put 
                         your gun down!

               Mr. Pink fades into the b.g., wanting no part of this.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe, you're making a terrible mistake 
                         I can't let you make.

                                     EDDIE
                         Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at 
                         daddy!

               Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

                                     JOE
                         Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry 
                         have been friends a long time, he 
                         ain't gonna shoot. We like each other 
                         too much.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Joe, if you kill that man, you die 
                         next. Repeat, if you kill that man, 
                         you die next!

               We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.

               MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

               Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

               Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange. Not taking his eyes off 
               him.

               Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to start 
               firing any minute.

               Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr. White.

               Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

               Nobody says nothing.

               FOUR SHOT of guys ready for violence. Mr. Pink in the 
               background.

                                     MR. PINK
                         C'mon, guys, nobody wants this. We're 
                         supposed to me fuckin' professionals!

               Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

                                     JOE
                         Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do 
                         this!

                                     JOE
                         Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on 
                         this.

                                     MR. WHITE
                         Don't ask me that.

                                     JOE
                         I'm not askin', I'm betting.

               Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

                                     EDDIE
                         Daddy, don't!

               Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

               Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his hands 
               up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

               Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the 
               chest.

               Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

               The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

               Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

               Joe's dead.

               Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving. 
               The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

               Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees, not 
               moving.

               Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the satchel 
               of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

               We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP, MEN 
               RUNNING to the warehouse.

               While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand 
               but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange lies.

               He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and 
               stroking his brow.

                                     MR. WHITE
                              (with much effort)
                         Sorry, kid. Looks like we're gonna 
                         do a little time.

               Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an effort:

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm a cop.

               Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's 
               brow.

                                     MR. ORANGE
                         I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

               Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr. 
               Orange's eyes.

               The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mr. White.

               The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see anything, 
               but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

                                     POLICE FORCE (O.S.)
                         Freeze, motherfucker! Drop your 
                         fucking gun!

               Mr. White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

               BANG!

               We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

               Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
