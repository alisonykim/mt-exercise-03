A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.
One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.
The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:
MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.
ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.
BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.
Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

got some tasty burgers. I ain't never

Mind if I try one of yours?
Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.
You wanna bite, they're real good.
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.
Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.
Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.
Let's hear it for our first
Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?
All right, let's see what you can
Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.
The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.
The two just stand face to face looking at each other.
I don't know what that was.
Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
Vincent shuffles off to the john.
Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.
Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.
Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.
Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?
But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.
Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?
Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.
Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.
Okay honey, we're getting you on
He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

gonna talk out to the car. Here we

unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!
I'm looking as fast as I can!
WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.
As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

What about the man you fought?
Really?! He won't be fighting no
So it all worked out in the finish?
We ain't at the finish, baby.
Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
If they find us, they'll kill us,
But they won't find us, will they?
Do you still want me to go with you?
I don't want to be a burden or a
Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
Butch continues to massage her crotch.
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?
Butch kisses her on the mouth.
Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.
Butch my love, the adventure begins.
Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
I think I cracked a rib.
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
Where are we going to go?
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.
So if we wanted, we could live in
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
But I do not speak Spanish.
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
my little mama ceta in no time.
Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
Butch keeps on from the other room.
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.
Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.
She looks at him for a moment.
She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.
SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.
ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".
Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to

Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

In a way. Why? Would you like for me
She reaches over and turns off the TV.
It's a little too early in the morning
How should I know, you were the one
No, imbecile, what was your dream
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
You just woke up from it.
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember mine. Did you know you talk
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
I don't know. I couldn't understand
Why don't you get up and we'll get
One more kiss and I'll get up.
Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
Almost nine in the morning. What
I'm gonna order a big plate of
eggs over easy, and five sausages.
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.
As he goes through the suitcase.
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
No, it's not. It's not here.
By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?
Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?
Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?
Butch freaks out, he punches the air.
Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.
You left it at the apartment.
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.
He touches her hand, she flinches.
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
He kisses her hand. Then rises.
Butch puts on his high school jacket.
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.
Because I'm going back to my apartment
Won't the gangsters be looking for
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.
I'll be back before you can say,
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
And with that, he's out the door.
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.
Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda

I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table  on the

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number .
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.
What he sees is a small compact Czech M submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.
With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his

That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he

the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!
DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"
Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.
TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.
The big man takes out a . Automatic and the Gawkers back
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.
He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
Oh my God, I've been shot!
That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.
Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.
The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Can I help you wit' somethin'?
Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.
Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
So you like chasing people, huh?
He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the . between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
Well guess what, big man, you caught
Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.
Look mister, this ain't any of your
I'm makin' it my business! Now
Now you on top, stand up and come to
Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.
After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.
Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just

a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are

guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.
Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' . sticking in
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.
WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.
Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
You said you waited for me?
Then how come they're all beat up?
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper  for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
The Gimp gets on its knees.
Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.
Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.
The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.
Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.
After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.
The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
Keep an eye on this one.
The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.
Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:
That's it... that's it boy, you're
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.
The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.
Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.
Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.
Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.
Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.
Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' . Automatic,
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.
Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.
Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.
Go on now, get your ass outta here.
Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.
Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.
Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: :.
The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.
Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
But what about all our bags?
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
Is everything well? Are we in danger?
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.
Where did you get this motorcycle?
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.
Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.
Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.
You ever read the Bible, Brett?
There's a passage I got memorized,
Ezekiel :. "The path of the

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver . Magnum.
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.
Then he listens to them talk.
Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.
He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.
The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.
The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late s dressed in a bathrobe.
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.
I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front

sign out in front of my house that

That's all we want. We don't wanna

No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?
Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.
You got to appreciate what an
situation is. If she comes home from

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.
About the car, is there anything I

under the sink, you got a bunch of

No whites, can't use 'em. We need to

with quilts and blankets. If a cop

won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.
The Wolf stops and turns around.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,

respectful, him manner more on guard.
Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,

Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
What is it? What is it?
Is that what I think it is?
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be

That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.
What the fuck's goin' on here?
Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel :. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. . here, he's the
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the

          .one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
          As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?
          We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for

Don't be silly. How much for Django?
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.
          The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?
          No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
          I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -
          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
          I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
What's this bizarre obsession they have
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
So what other archaic rituals are you people
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?
What part would they find the most offensive?
          All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Well in that case Django, after you.
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time

          It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;

and that would fall under the domain of the
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.
          You kill people and they give you a reward?
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
          Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?
          Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.
          I know what they look like, all right.
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE  stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.
          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;
          Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Now you can go get the marshall.

          Move that buckboard over there long ways

          Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.
          Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,

myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.

criminal justice system of The United

Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I

Django looks at him like, "as if..."
          A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.

          Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.

The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back

You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
          We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white

While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK

As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS .
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
          Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.
          Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?
          Ya want I should treat 'em like white
          No that's not what I said.
          Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

          Well that's it then... just treat 'em
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.
          Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.
          You mean you wanna dress like that?
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking

She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton

He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him

          As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH

Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little

LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
          whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it  into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.

          The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett , his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!
          Just who the hell are you two jokers?
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          - They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to

Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.
          Hold on I'm fuckin' with my eye holes.

He rips. it off his head in frustration.
          Well make you own goddamn masks!

          Well if all I hadda do was cut a bag, I
could cut it better then this.
          How 'bout-you Robert, can you see?
          Not too good. I mean if I.don't move my head,
I can see you pretty good ... . more or less.
But when I start ridin' the bag starts moving
all over, and I'm riding blind.
          Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He yanks it off his head.
          Did anybody bring any extra bags?
          No, no one brought a extra bag!
          Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?
          Shitfire, if you don't wear 'em as you ride
up, that just defeats the purpose.
Redfish, fatter then some , takes off his bag.
          I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!
          Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!

          O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
          Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.
          Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;
          I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
          Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!
          So, it would be nice to see.
          Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.
          pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like

first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as

the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.
          She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is

our picnic. What'd ya say, here?
          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Every German knows that story. Would you
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
I hafta admit, we make a good team.
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
          Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.

Maybe even share a last word. That's

Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and

a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

          The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
          The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.
          Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
          Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
          Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.
          The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.
          The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.
          As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          Still think I'm too green for Greenville?

          What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.
          ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala "Rocky" and
          The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them

SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING
          Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:
          Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.
          The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.
          amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS , peer down at their human cargo.
          Good god almighty these niggers stink!

The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.

          You should see it from the other side.
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.
          You'd be surprised what you can endure.
          Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.
          The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.
          We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER  starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.
          looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see  , not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.
Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.
          Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
Mr.Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty.
Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.
          On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.
          The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.
          I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.
          A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother,  , waits to meet her son, and
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
          Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
          I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
And you'll give that to him?
          I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.
          Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.
          As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
          And pretty soon she was adopted into a

Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for

fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,

registry book that indicates darkee female companion.
           Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys , rule the streets.
          And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.
          I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.
          Then... speak of the devil and the devil
          Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.
          Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.
          How long have you been a member?
          Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.
          Well said, and money well spent.
          It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my

They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.
          After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.

          The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.
          Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
          You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;
          She says she thinks you're cute.
          Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.
          Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
          Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
          Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
.and raise you four hundred more.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.
          I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.
          You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
          In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.

What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

          I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer

Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front

This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.
          Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
The party enters the billiard room.
           Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO
          Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;

Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.
          Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun_
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.
          The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?
          The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender

sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.

Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.
          Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to

Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.

in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.

Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
          The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.

down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
          Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker , and points out

get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a

Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
 every way is the nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,

Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;
          I think you lookin' for niggers to push
          Hold it...hold it, you done bought

Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.
          Boss Candie, which one did you buy?
          Well to me the pick of the litter is

Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.
          Now why did you do that?
          He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos

Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

Stephen limps back to the action.
          Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?
          All ready for your guest and his nigger.

Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.
          Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?
I believe you said she spoke German?
          Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?
          Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.
          Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.
          What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
          Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
          Last night. They brought her back this
          How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
          Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.
          How long she been in the box?
          What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.
          Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
          But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.

Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.
          Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.
          A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.

Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.
          This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
          I want you to pour some water in that
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.
          Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
          That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the

Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.
          That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.

A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.
          He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.
           Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
          Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
          I've been informed you do as well.
          It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.
          With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
He gives her a pleasant smile.
They call you Hildi, but your real name
          Yes. How do you know that?
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
          on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
          I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
          Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
          I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
He points at the adjoining door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.
          The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
          WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
          in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.
          You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
          I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
She doesn't say anything in return.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.
          I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.
          I'm done here, may I be excused?
She moves off to another part of the house.
          Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
          Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;
          Samson's the champion. The other two
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;
          Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.
          A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.
          I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
          Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
          Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.
          I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.
          Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.
          When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
          Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston
          You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.
          What does that hafta do with the price of
          You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
          Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.
          Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
          Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.
          Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.
          Don't stall me bitch, you know who?
          At the table? I don't know him.
          You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
          Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.
          Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
          Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
          But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
          In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...
          Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
The White people at the table get very happy.
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
          Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.
          It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.
          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
          When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
          So you haven't seen her back?
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
          In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;
          I thought you said you didn't know him?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.
          I said, you said, you didn't know him?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers  are up to something, and now he's
You indicated earlier you would be
Well in that case allow me to propose
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.
          Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
          What, you mean get outta my chair?
          If you could manage it. It's about dessert.
          I would rather tell you in private.
          We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?
          Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
          Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.
          Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
If you'll excuse me a moment.
          A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads  that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
          Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -
          What the hell you talkin' about?
          They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
          Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.
          Did he give you any money?
          - Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.
          Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
          Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.
          If she's who they want, why the whole
          Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
          Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
          Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.
          I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.
          Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
          Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
           The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon
          There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.
          That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
          Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
          Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.
          Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.
          Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.
          Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.
          Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
          Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
          Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.
          Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.
          Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
          And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.
          Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
May I lift my hands from the table top in
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
          INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
          Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
          Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
          Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;
          It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
          You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.
          You know what I think you are?
What you think I am? No I don't.
          I think you are a bad loser.
And I think you're an abysmal winner.
          Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
          Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks
You really want me to shake your hand?
          The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...
          He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
 is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.
          Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...
          Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
          I don't know 'bout no girl.
          How 'bout that German white man I came
          Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
          Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.
Django thinks, "How does he know?"
          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;
          Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
          Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
          You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.
          Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.
          He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.
          How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
          Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.
          Got to do it, boy. TWO...
          Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn/blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.
          Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;
          Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
          She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.
          You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;
          Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END
          Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
          I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.
          That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
          And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.
          Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
He walks behind Django with the poker.
          You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.
          You leavin', that's what you can take
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.
          Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
          So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
          She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
          The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.
          It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and

and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.
          I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.
          All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
          Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.
          We can't use that skinny bastard.
          We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.
          No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.
          Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.
          Look, no one tole' me 'bout -
          - No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
          Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.
          Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
          Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.
          He can't go in there with them.
          Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!
          Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

nothing to say I wanna hear.
          You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.
          I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
          And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
          Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
          Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.
          And you ain't paid him back yet?
          You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;
          How'd you like to make eleven thousand
          How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;
          Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.
          Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
          You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.
          That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
          If you got something to say, say it.
          The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.
          Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
          Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.
          But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
          The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the

the head, in their sleep - don't matter.
          Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
          No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
          I think so... . what did these jokers do again?
          Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
          I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
          I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.
          What about that cowboy fella in the lead?
          Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin

the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
          Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.
          I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.
          You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
          What's your deal? You tell us who they are
          I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
          Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?
          go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.
          "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.
          Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.
          Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
          I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?
          Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
          This white man, was the black his slave?
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
          Bunch of shootin, master got shot.
          And why did he do that?
          The nigger and the German were actin as if they
Floyd is starting to get convinced.
          Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
          Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.
          When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.
          You're all right for a black fella!
          Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"
          We'll give you that pack horse.
          What's them saddle bags filled with?
          I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
          Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;
          Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;
          Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
          A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit

He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...
          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.

him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...
After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.

Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.
          First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.
          The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.
          Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a

          Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him

          Now girl, I'm tryin' to be nice.

Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the

Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
down hill heading back for the big house.

satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.
          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.

them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.
          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and

She wants to know what she's done?
Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.
          Then I demand to know what this is about,
and where do you propose to take me?
The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German;
          Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.
          The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
          the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.
          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation

a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,

Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.

Now the two Germans are alone.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
and places it in front of the fraulein.
He sits. Their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed

The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
.Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...
          He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
He slips it on her foot...
Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;
"if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
He removes her foot from his lap.
She stares defiant daggers into him.

Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the

Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
silver SS FLASK, and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.
          Into the phone in German he says;
          Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
taken there seats, and we're ready
Step one, in Hans master plan, done.

He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern

behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.

He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
face right in the middle of the hood.
In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the

Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot

In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
radio set up in the tavern.
Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,

Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian

          Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.
          leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.

into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,

He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!

the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in

door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,

          Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
be here. This is your premiere, you
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.

his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both

Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

          He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.

The third person watching the video is the person who
lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
In her prime  it was Japanese industrialists,
film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
paying no attention to the video.

being the most popular gun in

shit? It actually says that on the

While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little

pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
moment, then Jackie opens the door.
I was expecting you. Come in.
Jackie holds the door open for him.
Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in

night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
"WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.

Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.
Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and

Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
the way a cop would. She finds the . pistol in his

Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.
A coffee table lays between them.
Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...
I just came here to talk.

thing to talk about. What you willing
Ordell looks at her a moment and says;

Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.

and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera

She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.
As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
That'll change her expression, he'd bet.
She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort

quite pretty, no older than twenty.
She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway

Jackie looks at her tray of food.
It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.

sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
nods her head again, and then walks off.
As he watches her walk away from the cops...
You said it yourself. Ray wants
Ordell, he don't give a shit about
the money. Money won't convict him,
guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in

Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
young girl eating in the food court.
Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
her the ashtray Jackie was using.
Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
shopping bag and walks out of the food court.
Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.
Max turns back on the older woman all alone.
She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
woman heads out of the mall.

Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
monster waves all over the place.

The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
into the place and going up to the bar...
A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.

MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
head of hair comes into the f.g....
The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.
Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
Good luck. That guy's been in there
Well, I guess I better look for

Jackie looks at her a moment.

moves her head to it during the conversation.
How long you been with Ordell?

"You may leave us now." It's all part
of his pathetic attempt to be "the

Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.
There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
what she wants them to think.
As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not

Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
You know, a good cop won't let you
know he knows you're fulla shit.
All he needed was a reasonable
one change. Ordell thinks it's just
too hot right now to bring in all his
money. He knows you're watching him,
and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
stash where it is, but he wants to
bring in fifty thousand for bail in
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the
Well, you know I'm not going to show
him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
thousand and there it is - on top.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
Walker put the money in, and I didn't
know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Then you're out and you get nothing.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
That's why you don't make a move till
I come out of the fitting room.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone
It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout

one change. That bitch you saw in the
mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
Me an Louis went over to her place

Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.
Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.
Louis turns back to the television.
Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her

see "CABO SAN LUCAS" with a big circle around it. On the
California side we see "LAX" in a similar circle. The
tiny figure of a black AIRPLANE appears in the Cabo

Cabo, flying towards LAX, leaving a dotted line behind
it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black

Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
and is stopped by a PASSENGER.
Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink

someplace else. What do you think?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Oh, that's taken care of. I called

black guy from the photo, is at the other desk on the

Max stands up, takes the sport coat from the back of his

Winston, still on the phone, looks up.

We see a montage of the individual characters in route to
In her Honda, smoking a cigarette, looking cool as usual,
driving to the mall. Her car plays seventies soul.
In his Cadillac Seville, cruising down Hawthorne
Boulevard to the mall. He plays hid Delfonics CD.
In Melanie's Toyota drive towards the mall. Melanie
drives singing along with Kate Bush on her car stereo.
Jackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the
Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
the rest of the bag with beach towels.
Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.
Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
around. Any one of them could be surveillance.
She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young
Asian saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's/May designer
The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.
Oh, my God. You look so cool.
Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.
This looks pretty good on me.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You
wear this to a business meeting,
you're the badass in the room. But
you can go out dancing in this too.
I think I'm gonna just get this for
today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
you mind ringing this up while I
Jackie walks into the fitting room.
She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
cubicles on her right, enters the last one.
She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's/May bag.
A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.
Are you getting that black suit?
Do you got something for me?
A Robinson's/May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
Jackie picks up her Robinson's/May bag, filled with
books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.
She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
and lies it on top of the bag.
As she does all this Melanie continues talking.
We coulda worked this. You know that,
dontcha? You would've made out a lot
better than you're going to, believe
Jackie slides the Robinson's/May bag with money under the
Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.
I put a little cherry on top. You're
right. What the hell he ever do for
Now be careful with that bag. You
don't want it ripping open on you in
We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.
Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's/May bag. She
sticks her uniform in the flight bag.
Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
Robinson's/May bag filled with half of a million dollars.
Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
counter where Amy waits for her.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
the suit - get out of that damn
As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
... Jackie walks out of Robinson's/May hurriedly into the
main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of

That's a nice outfit on her. I'm

Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
Job a little too much for you?
Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.
Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
a natural-born smart ass to change.
I'll be over here. You're too
Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.
Goddammit, not till I tell ya.
He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'
Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
to do what he was doing.
He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's/May bag
and head down a different aisle.
He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
fight is said tense and low.
I'm getting out of here. What do you
Fuck you. I can carry it.
She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
Gimme that bag before I knock you out
Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
Fuck you with your chill pill.
Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.
Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
in through Bullocks. I know where it
is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?
Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
see he has a searching look on his face.
You have no idea where you parked, do
Jesus, but if you two aren't the
biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
life... How did you ever rob a bank?
When you robbed banks, did you have
to look for your car then too? No
Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
They walk it; it's not it.
Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
Is it this aisle or the next one
In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
telling you, keep your mouth shut.
Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
See, just where I fuckin' said it
He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
and yells through the passenger window;
Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.
Not right now. I'm just killing time
waiting for my wife. But thanks,
Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.
Oh, my God. You look so cool.
Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.
Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."
Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.
He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.
He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.
He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.
Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
his before he can see a reaction.
He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
Robinson's/May bag close to her chest.
He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
cash, then leaves stopping to say;
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.
As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
years dealing with people who take
incredible risks. You walk over to
that counter, you're gonna find out
... then walks over to Amy.
Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
left a bag of beach towels in the
Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
think they're in the last stall.
Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.
He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;
Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
The bartender hands him the phone.
A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
I got it. Listen, there's something
else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
That's what I got to talk to you
about. You see, Melanie was giving me
- Not now, pick me up.
The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
they got all them car dealerships.
We're gonna leave this heap in a
parking lot and get one the cops
That's what I gotta tell you. She
bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
carry the bag. Started running her
right away when we came out where the
car was parked, so she got on me
about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
is it that one?" She was totally
So what, you left her there.
Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;
Maybe... but at that moment... I
Well, if you had to do it, you had to
do it. What we don't want is that
bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
looks inside the bag for the longest time.
Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
You said five hundred and fifty!
So you light, ain't you. You light
Look, that's the bag she came out
with. She never even put her hand in
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she
came out with that bag and I took it
We went to the parking lot.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a
Fuck you for asking me that.
Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.
Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.
What's that gonna tell you" If I was
really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.
Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the

Then she throws forty thousand in

... she gave it to somebody else
first, before Melanie went in the
It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
You know who I saw in the dress
I didn't really think anything of it.
No - I did wonder what he was doing
there, but didn't think it had
anything to do with us. You know like
maybe he was there with his wife or
You gonna tell me who it was?
Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
You see Max Cherry in the dress
department. We're about to be handed
half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
me when I'm talking to you! And you
don't think nothing of him being
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
Hell, yes, they know each other. He
How am I supposed to know that?
You know the motherfucker's a bail

Man, I don't want to hear your

Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
lost all the goddam money I got in
the world! Let me tell you the
your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.
This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
He slumps over - his life gone.
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.
Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving

Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
You didn't. I would think with all
this on your mind, you'd wait till
I got there early. I've had my eye on
this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
got there early. The idea was to try
on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
did, get them to wrap it up, and
change back into my uniform. That's
what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
with fifty thousand, and go home.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
And someone killed her for it.
Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.
Where's the bag she gave you?
She didn't give me one. I told you
before, Melanie wasn't part of the
plan. Ordell must of told her to do
it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
bag, and takes off. What am I
supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
my fucking underwear. I had to get
dressed before I could do anything.
So I put this back on 'cause could

I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked
into a strip bar sometime around
three thirty and never came out. The
bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
and-a-half from where Louis was found
dead. It looks like Louis's friend
shot him twice at point blank range.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three
murders we can link him to. We have
the storage unit where he keeps his
guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
warrant to go in and get him. And we

I have no evidence of your taking
anything. You didn't pay for your
snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
was glad to see that. You've been

marked bills stuffed in her shorts
when they found her, which goes a
long way backing up your story.

Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.
You're right, that was Ordell. You
have time, you think you could find
out for me where he's staying?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, long as you know.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the

panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.

All Winston had to do was ask around.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME

A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the

the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The

it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.

Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece

the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.
One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.
The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.
He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.
Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

at the happy side of all this?
             And what would that happy side be?

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.

blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.
He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

member of the audience will read the significance of her

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.
Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.
             Let's see how    good you really are.
Try and land    a blow. If you land a
single blow,    I'll bow down and call
The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
He deftly moves out of the way.
The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.
Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;
          Come now woman, can't you even hit
          Your ability really is quite poor.
He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.
Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.
          Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.
Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.
          Give up? Or care to try again?
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,
that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.
She takes the sword from him and tries again.
But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
          That blade's sharp. Careful not to

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...
...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.
          Now that really would be a shame.
He takes the sword from her grasp...
The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.
The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.
He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.
          I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
and you can't even make me break a

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;
With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.

          If you wish to speak romantic
languages, you've come to the wrong
          Please don't cut my arm off!
          It's my arm now. I can do with it

          Have you ever felt this before?
          Compared to me you're as helpless

mine. You may lose it    yet.
Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.
The Bride stands behind him, watching.
He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.
He turns to the new student;
          Since your arm now belongs to me, I
want it strong. Can you do that?
          I can, but not that close.
          I can put my hand through that at

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.
The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....
Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.
Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.
            If you want to eat like a dog, I

and sleep like a human being, pick

He walks off in a huff.
Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth .
          In that pit, is a rat.
We see one lone rat in the huge pit.
          In the sky, is a bird.
Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.
Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu.
At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.
Trying to catch the rat to no avail.
A golden arrow kills the rat.
She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.
She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.
Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.
Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.
She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.
AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....
...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.
With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...
Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...
Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...
THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...
Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.
A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the
tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.
The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;

he finishes telling the tale of last night.

T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.
          Can I look at the sword?
          That's my money in that black case,
          Well then, it's your sword now.
The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.
She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.
          So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

He looks over at Elle and grins.
She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.
He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.
Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.
He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the

Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

          What do you mean by that?
          How many years has she been alive?

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.
The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.
The two cars pass each other.
The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;

Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.
She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...
He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.
She points the shotgun straight down at his face.
She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.
Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.
The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;

sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up

I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed
The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the backseat.
He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both him and the
Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of the
getaway car. He's easily doing  mph, dodging in and out of
traffic. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking
to his wounded passenger in the backseat.
They are the only two in the car.
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now! You're hurt. You're hurt really
fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.

be able to help you. We're just gonna

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right
here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please
Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange. Cradling
the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.
Go ahead and be scared, you've been
brave enough for one day. I want you
to just relax now. You're not gonna
die, you're gonna be fine. When Joe
gets here, he'll make ya a hundred
Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress. He's
still holding his hand. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend.

in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
Lie back down, and try to -
I'm going to die! I need a doctor!
I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr. Pink steps
Was that a fucking set-up or what?
Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.
Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
How the fuck do you think? The cops
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked

You even doubt it? I don't think we

all those cops come from, huh? One
minute they're not there, the next
minute they're there. I didn't hear
any sirens. The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time. Unless a patrol car
is cruising that street, at that

seventeen blue boys out there. All
loaded for bear, all knowing exactly
what the fuck they were doing, and
they were all just there! Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm. But those
there, they were waiting for us.
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there. And after we got
away, I've just been dealin' with
Well, you better start thinking about
it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking
about it. In fact, that's all I'm
thinking about. I came this close to
just driving off. Whoever set us up,
knows about this place. There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me. For all we know, there's cops,
driving fast, on their way here now.
Let's go in the other room...
The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. We move
past it, and see down a hall.
At the end of the hall is a bathroom. The bathroom door is
partially closed, restricting our view. Mr. Pink is obscured,
but Mr. White is in view.
What the fuck am I doing here? I
felt funny about this job right off.
As soon as I felt it I should said
"No thank you", and walked. But I
never fucking listen. Every time I
ever got burned buying weed, I always
knew the guy wasn't right. I just
felt it. But I wanted to believe
him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa baby.
But it's never Thai stick. And I
always said if I felt that way about
a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I

As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon.
They didn't let their presence be
known until after Mr. Blonde went
off. I'm not sayin' they weren't
there, I'm sayin' they were there.
But they didn't move in till Mr.
Blonde became a madman. That's how I
know we were set up. You can see

the fuck would Joe hire somebody
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I
gotta get out that door, and you're
standing in my way, one way of the
other, you're gettin' outta my way.
That's the way I look at it. A choice
between doin' ten years, and takin'
no choice at all. But I ain't no
madman either. What the fuck was Joe

So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue?
Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he

I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a

Oh, you and Joe go back a long time.

hold off till Joe got here.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're
on our own. Now, I don't know a

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink, then
I told him where I was from a few
days ago. It was just a casual

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.
We had just gotten away from the
cops. He just got shot. It was my
fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a
fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming.

gonna die right then and there. I'm
tryin' to comfort him, telling him
not to worry, he's gonna be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him. And he
asked me what my name was. I mean,

And I'm very sad about that. But

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.
Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in the
Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and realistic
fight. They go at each other like a couple of alley cats.
As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:
Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:
Ya wanna fuck with me?! I'll show
The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. Mr.
White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.
Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.
The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece
Fuck you, White! I didn't create
with it. You're acting like a first-
year fuckin' thief. I'm actin like a
professional. They get him, they can
get you, they get you, they get closer
to me, and that can't happen. And
at me like it's my fault. I didn't
tell him my name. I didn't tell him
where I was from. I didn't tell him
what I knew better than to tell him.
Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost
told me your name. You, buddy, are
stuck in a situation you created. So
if you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.
Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.
So if you wanna shoot somebody, put
that gun in your mouth and shoot
Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:
You kids don't play so rough.
The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.
Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and
Mr. Blonde! You okay? We thought you
Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter and
starts walking around the warehouse, checking the place out.
He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he just
eats his hot dog and sips his coke.
This is making Pink and White nervous as hell. But Mr. Pink
We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.
Really, how did you get away?
Mr. Blonde walks the loft. Silent.
You saw what happened to me, I found
We were hopin' you two would be
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr. Blue and you?
Blonde walks away from the window.
We were worried the cops got ya.
Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.
He got it in the belly. He's still
alive, but won't be for long.

Silence takes over the room. Mr. Blonde stops moving.
After a few beats the silence is broken.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.
Three cars are parked out front. Mr. Blonde is walking towards

The three crooks share a frightening laugh. We slowly ZOOM

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

Funny you should mention it. That's

That I should've picked you up?
No. That your head's been up your

says "Vic, you're back, thank god.
Finally somebody who knows what the

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but
there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on the

The sound of the machine dominates the sound track.

We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.
The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment
getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket and slips
DOLLY fast toward the front door knob. Freddy's hand comes
into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go. We MOVE UP to his

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.
Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the
passenger seat. Freddy and Mr. White are in the backseat
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about,
black women ain't the same as white

Let me tell you guys a story. In one
of daddy's clubs there was this black
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway,
this chick, Elois, was a man-eater-
upper. I bet every guy who's ever
met her has jacked off to her at
least once. You know who she looked
like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV
show "Get Christie Love"? She was a
black female cop. She always used to
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on. I totally dug it. What
the fuck was the name of the chick
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier
was the other one. Pam Grier made
the movies. Christie Love was like a
Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
What the fuck was that chick's name?
Oh this is just great, I'm totally
Well, whoever she was, Elois looked
like her. So one night I walk into
the club, and no Elois. Now the
bartender was a wetback, he was a
friend of mine, his name was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's
Lady E was married to this real piece
of dog shit. I mean a real animal.
And apparently he would so things to

Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something. Anyway,
Elois plays it real cool. And waits
for the next time this bag of shit
gets drunk. So one night the guy
gets drunk and passes out on the
couch. So while the guy's inebriated,
she strips him naked. Then she takes
some crazy glue and glues his dick
The car reacts to how horrible that would be.
I'm dead fuckin' serious. She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together. The
paramedics had to come and cut it

talk about is what you're going to

who the members of the team are Eddie

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the
layout of the jewelry store on it.
I'll move on, when I feel like it.
All you guys got the goddamn message?
I'm so goddamn mad I can hardly talk.
We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.
CUSTOMERS coming and going. STORE CLERKS waiting on customers
While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr. White
Let's go over it. Where are you?
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody come in or go
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's
parked across the street till I give
him the signal, then he pulls up in
and employees in the display area.
Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.
You two take the manager in the back
and make him give you the diamonds.
We're there for those stones, period.
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go
off. We're out of there in two
minutes, not one second longer. What

is break that son-of-a-bitch in two.

It's the moment of the robbery. The alley is empty.
In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose. Guns FIRING,
people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING, glass
A car whips around the corner, into the alley.
The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.
Freddy opens the driver's side door. A bloody SCREAMING Mr.

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

As he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened to him
and what he's done. SLOW MOTION.
Mr. White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car. He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.
Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is CRYING.
We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car. Except this time, we never leave Freddy.
I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed
MEDIUM SHOT on the door. Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and Mr.
Pink walk through it. They stop in their tracks.
We see what they see. Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground, shot
full of holes. The cop slumped over in his chair, a bloody
mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding his wound.
Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the shot.
Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde / Toothpick Vic.
Blonde went crazy. He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and was
Who cares what he was gonna do to
Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop. The cop and the
chair tip over. Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him once
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that? Worse or better?
Look, Eddie, he was pullin' a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through the
door, he was gonna blow you to hell
and make off with the diamonds.
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya? That
sick piece of shit was a stone cold
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him. He talked about
what he was going to do when he was
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to
me. Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.
Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind. According
to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill
you. Then when we came back, kill
us, grab the diamonds, and scram.
That's your story? I'm correct about
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth. I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of Nice Guy Eddie.
There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has
The man you killed was just released
from prison. He got caught at a
company warehouse full of hot items.
He could've walked away. All he had
to do was say my dad's name. But
instead he shut his mouth and did
his time. He did four years for us,
and he did 'em like a man. And we
were very grateful. So, Mr. Orange,
you're tellin' me this very good
friend of mine, who did four years
for my father, who in four years
never made a deal, no matter what
they dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's just
gonna decide, right out of the fuckin'
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
Why? It'll just be more bullshit.
Eddie steps out of his CLOSEUP and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway. He walks into the room.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.
Mr. White brings his . up at Joe.
Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of firearms.
Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.
Have you lost your fucking mind? Put
Mr. Pink fades into the b.g., wanting no part of this.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at
Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry

ain't gonna shoot. We like each other

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.
Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face. Joe brings his hands
up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.
Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.
The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.
Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest heaving.
The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.
Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees, not
Mr. Pink is standing motionless. Finally he grabs the satchel
of diamonds and RUNS out the door.
We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP, MEN
While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN. He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange lies.
He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME CLOSEUP of Mr. White.
The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside. We don't see anything,
but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.
Mr. White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.
We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.
Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.
