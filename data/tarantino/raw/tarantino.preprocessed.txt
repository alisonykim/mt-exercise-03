The front door <unk> open , and Mia and Vincent dance <unk> style into the house , singing a <unk> the song from the previous scene .
They finish their little dance , laughing .
The two just stand face to face looking at each other .
I don &apos;t know what that was .
Mia moves away to attend to both .
Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big <unk> coat rack in the <unk> .
That was a little bit more information than I needed to know , but go right Vincent <unk> off to the <unk> .
Mia moves to her CD player , thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one : <unk>

Like a little girl playing cowboy , she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper .

Maybe a little too fat , but not bad for a first try .
Mia thinks so anyway .
Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter .
She SLAPS the lighter against her leg , trying to light it <unk> like Vince did .
What do you know , she did it !
Mia &apos;s one happy <unk> .
She <unk> brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke , lighting it up , then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed .
The <unk> cigarette is brought up to her lips , and she takes a long , cool drag .
Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket .
But wait , her fingers touch something else .
Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside , the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance .
<unk> a big smile , Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her <unk> !
Vince , you little <unk> nut , you &apos;ve been holding out on me .
Vincent stands at the sink , washing his hands , talking to One drink and leave .
Don &apos;t be rude , but drink your drink quickly , say goodbye , walk out the door , get in your car , and go down the road .
Mia has the <unk> heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table .
Taking her <unk> hundred dollar bill like a human <unk> , she quickly snorts the Her head JERKS back .
Her hands go to her nose ( which feels like it &apos;s on fucking fire ) , something is <unk> wrong .

And that &apos;s all you &apos;re Now that he &apos;s given himself a little <unk> talk , Vincent &apos;s ready for whatever &apos;s waiting for him on the other side of that door .
So he goes through it .
We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room , where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll .
She &apos;s twisted on her back .
Blood and <unk> are down her front .
And her face is <unk> .
Not out of the <unk> of pain , but just the opposite , the <unk> in her face are so <unk> , she lies still with her mouth wide open .

After Mia walks inside .
Vincent continues to look at where she was .

Then exits FRAME leaving it empty .
WE HEAR his Malibu FADE UP On the cartoon &quot; SPEED <unk> . &quot;
<unk> is giving a <unk> <unk> of all the features on his race car &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which he does at the beginning of every episode .
OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN &apos;S VOICE ... . We &apos;re in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in <unk> , California , in the year .
BUTCH &apos;S MOTHER , <unk> , stands in the doorway leading into the living room .
Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer .
The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old Butch , stop watching TV a second .
We got a special visitor .
Now do you remember when I told you your daddy Well this here is Capt.
Koons .
He was in the <unk>
camp with Daddy .
<unk> .
<unk> steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy &apos;s <unk> .
When Koons speaks , he speaks with a slight Texas Hello , little man .
Boy I sure heard a bunch about you .
See , I was a good friend of your Daddy &apos;s .
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five yourself , but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were , for as long as we were , you the other .
If it had been me who had not made it , Major Coolidge would be talkin &apos; right now to my son Jim .
But the way it worked out is I &apos;m talkin &apos; to you , Butch .
I got somethin &apos; for The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket .
This watch I got here was first It was bought during the First World War in a little <unk> store in the day he set <unk> for Paris .
It made by the first company to ever make wrist watches .
You see , up until that watch every day he was in the war .
Then when he had done his duty , he went home to your <unk> <unk> , took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol &apos; coffee can .
And in that can it <unk> &apos; til called upon by his country to go <unk> and fight the Germans once again .
This time they called it World it to your granddad for good luck .
good as his old man &apos;s .
Your granddad was a <unk> and he was killed with all the other <unk> at the battle of <unk> Island .
Your granddad was facing death and he knew it .
None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin &apos; that island alive .
So three days before the Japanese took <unk> asked a <unk> on an Air Force transport named <unk> , a man he had never met before in his life , to deliver to his infant son , who he had never seen in the flesh , his gold watch .
Three days later , your kept his word .
After the war was over , he paid a visit to your father , his <unk> &apos;s gold watch .
This watch .
This watch was on your Daddy &apos;s wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi .
He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp .
Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it &apos;d be <unk> .
The way your Daddy looked at it , that watch was your birthright .
And he &apos;d be damned if and <unk> were gonna put their greasy <unk> hands on his boy &apos;s birthright .
So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin &apos; .
His ass .
Five long years , he wore this watch up his ass .
Then when he died of <unk> , he gave me the watch .
I hid with uncomfortable <unk> of metal up my ass for two years .
Then , after seven years , I was sent home to my family .
And now , little man , I give the watch to you .
Capt.
Koons hands the watch to Butch .
A little hand comes The <unk> old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia : trunks , shoes and gloves .

Klondike steps inside , closing the door on the <unk> <unk> He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook .
Butch hops off the table and , without a word , Klondike helps him on with the robe , which says on the back : &quot; <unk> BUTCH The two men head for the door .
Klondike opens the door for As Butch steps into the hallway , the <unk> goes <unk> .
Klondike closes the door behind him , leaving us in the quiet , We hear over the black and white title : Well Dan , that had to be the brutal fight this city has ever seen .

Butch leans forward .
Esmarelda , keeping her eyes on the road , passes a cigarette back to him .

The name is Spanish , but I &apos;m It mean &quot; Esmarelda of the <unk> . &quot;

Pot bellies are Well you should be happy , &apos; cause you Shut up , <unk> !

If they find us , they &apos;ll kill us , But they won &apos;t find us , will they ?
Do you still want me to go with you ?
I don &apos;t want to be a <unk> or a Butch &apos;s hand goes out of frame and starts <unk> her Fabienne , I want you to be with me .
Butch continues to massage her crotch .
Butch ?

Butch kisses her on the mouth .
Butch &apos;s head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure .
Fabienne &apos;s face is alone in the frame .
Butch my love , the <unk> begins .
Same motel room , except empty .
WE HEAR THE <unk> RUNNING in the bathroom .
The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway .
We see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to <unk> She &apos;s drying her head with a towel .
Butch is inside the shower washing up .
We see the <unk> of his naked body through the <unk> glass of the shower door .

Butch exits the bathroom .
We stay on Fabienne as she brushes Butch keeps on from the other room .
Time for bed .
Sweet dream , <unk> .
Fabienne brushes her teeth .
We watch her for a moment or She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question , only to find him sound asleep in bed .
She looks at him for a moment .
She exits frame , going back in the bathroom .
WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed .

We find Butch still Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time .
She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before .

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss .
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of Almost nine in the morning .

Oh yes , that looks nice .
To drink , a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee .

Any time of the day is a good time for pie .

And on top , a thin No , it &apos;s not .

Fabienne can hardly speak , she &apos;s never seen Butch this way .

Oh it most definitely should be here , but it &apos;s not .
So where is it ?
Butch lowers his voice , which only serves to make him more Fabienne , that was my father &apos;s fuckin &apos; watch .
You know what my father went through to git me that watch ? ...

Now all this other shit , you coulda set on you not to forget my father &apos;s watch .
Now think , did you get it ?

Butch freaks out , he punches the air .
Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner , Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT <unk> the wall .
Butch looks toward her , suddenly calm .
You left it at the apartment .
He bends down in front of the woman who has <unk> to the floor .
He touches her hand , she <unk> .
If you did leave it at the apartment , it &apos;s not your fault .
I had you bring a bunch of stuff .
I reminded you about it , but I didn &apos;t <unk> how personal the watch was to me .
If all I gave a fuck about was my watch , I should &apos;ve told you .

I &apos;ll be back before you can say , Well maybe not that fast , but fast .
He kisses her once more and heads for the door .
And with that , he &apos;s out the door .
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her .
Butch is beating the <unk> wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street .
Of all the fuckin &apos; things she coulda forgot , she <unk> my father &apos;s watch .

He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes <unk> &apos; through the front door .
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street , Everything seems normal .
More or less the right number of cars in the street .
None of the parked cars appear out of place .
None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside .
Basically , it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch peers around a wall , taking in the <unk> information .
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything .
He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard .
Across the street from Butch &apos;s building , on the corner , is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant .
A big sign sticks up in the air , with the name &quot; Teriyaki Donut &quot; and a <unk> of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice .
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building .
Once again , everything appears normal the laundry room , the pool , his apartment door nothing appears Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment , number .
He steps outside the door and listens inside .
Nothing .
Butch slowly <unk> the key into the door , quietly opening He <unk> steps inside , shuts the door and takes a quick look around .
Obviously , no one is there .
Butch walks into his modest kitchen , and opens the He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it .
With carton in hard , Butch <unk> the apartment .
Then he His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat , clean and <unk> .
The only things personal in his room are a few boxing <unk> , an <unk> silver medal , a framed <unk> of &quot; Ring Magazine &quot; with Butch on the cover , and a <unk> of Jerry <unk> and one of George <unk> .
Sure enough , there &apos;s the watch just like he said it was : On the bedside table , hanging on his little kangaroo statue .
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen .
He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts .
<unk> down the milk , he opens the box , takes out two Pop Tarts and Butch glances to his right , his eyes fall on something .
What he sees is a small compact <unk> M <unk> gun with a huge silencer on it , lying on his kitchen counter .

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun .
Vincent is <unk> <unk> with twenty bullets <unk> <unk> him off his feet , <unk> him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom .
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger , Vincent Butch stands frozen , <unk> at what just happened .
His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent , down to the powerful piece of <unk> in his grip .
With the respect it deserves , Butch <unk> places the M Then he exits the apartment , quickly .
Butch , not running , but walking very rapidly , crosses the ... comes out of the apartment building , crosses the street ... ... and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT .
Butch <unk> the car into gear and drives away .
The big wide smile of a <unk> breaks across his face .
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his Butch looks out the window at his former home .
That &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna beat &apos; em , This makes the boxer laugh out loud .
As he laughs , he flips a tape in the <unk> player .
When the MUSIC starts , he He drives by the apartment , but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut .
Butch is still <unk> , singing along with the song , as we The big man himself , Marsellus Wallace , exit Teriyaki Donut , carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam <unk> of coffee .
He steps off the curb , crossing the street in front of Butch &apos;s car .
This is the first time we see Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front When Marsellus is in front of Butch &apos;s car , he casually glances to his left , sees Butch , continues walking ... then STOPS !
<unk> : &quot; Am I really seeing what I &apos;m seeing ? &quot;
Butch doesn &apos;t wait for the big man to answer his own question .
He STOMPS on the gas pedal .
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus , sending him , the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour .
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is <unk> by a gold <unk> <unk> , BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending Butch sits dazed and confused in the <unk> mess of what at one time was Fabienne &apos;s Honda .

He HITS a <unk> WOMAN in the hip .
She falls to the ground , Oh my God , I &apos;ve been shot !
That &apos;s all Butch needs to see .
He &apos;s outta here .
Butch is in a mad , limping RUN .
The big man &apos;s hot on his ass with a <unk> wobbly run .
Butch cuts across traffic and <unk> into a business with a <unk> , a <unk> &apos; boy , stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when , all of a sudden , chaos in the form of Can I help you wit &apos; somethin &apos; ?
Butch quickly takes <unk> of the situation , than stands Now you just wait one goddamn minute Before Maynard can finish his threat , Marsellus CHARGES in .
He doesn &apos;t get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist The gangster &apos;s feet go out from under him and the big man Outside , two police cars with their SIRENS <unk> race by .
Butch <unk> on the fallen body , <unk> him twice more in Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus &apos; hand , than grabs <unk> So you like chasing people , huh ?

Now Now you on top , stand up and come to Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter .
As soon as he gets there , Maynard <unk> OFF , HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun , knocking Butch down and out .
After Butch goes down , Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone .
Marsellus Wallace , from his position on the floor , <unk> watches the pawnshop owner <unk> a number .
Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings .
Then it picks up .
Zed ?
It &apos;s Maynard .
The <unk> just They are tied up in two separate chairs .
In their mouths are two S &amp; <unk> ball <unk> ( a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths ) .
Both men are Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and <unk> both guys until they &apos;re wide awake and wet as <unk> .
The two prisoners look up at their <unk> .
Maynard stands in front of them , fire extinguisher in one hand , shotgun in the other , and Marsellus &apos; .
sticking in Nobody kills anybody in my place of Without saying another word , Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them .
WE HEAR , on the other side of the curtains , Maynard let Zed Butch and Marsellus look around the room .
The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon .
After taking in their <unk> , Butch and Marsellus look at each other , all <unk> of <unk> gone , replaced by a terror they both share at what they &apos;ve gotten themselves into .
Maynard and <unk> come through the curtains .
Zed is an even more <unk> version of Maynard , if such a thing is possible .
The two <unk> are obviously brothers .
Where Maynard is a vicious <unk> , Zed is a deadly cobra .
Zed walks in and stands in front of the two <unk> .
He <unk> them for a You said you waited for me ?
Then how come they &apos;re all beat up ?
They did that to each other .
They was fightin &apos; when they came in .

Well , I guess you &apos;ll just wake &apos; em Maynard opens a trap door in the floor .
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a He gives it a rough yank and , from below the floor , rises The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather <unk> gear .
There are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> here and there on the body .
On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a <unk> for a mouth .
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large Zed takes the chair , sits it in front of the two prisoners , then lowers into it .
Maynard hands The Gimp &apos;s leash to Zed , The Gimp gets on its knees .
Maynard hangs back while Zed <unk> the two men .
Then with his little finger , Zed does a silent &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ... &quot; just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two .
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims .
The <unk> &apos;s eyes go from one to the other inside the mask .
Zed continues his silent <unk> with his finger moving left to right , then it stops .
After a beat , THE CAMERA MOVES to the right , <unk> in on Naw , drag big boy to Russell &apos;s old Zed grabs Marsellus &apos; chair and DRAGS him into Russell &apos;s old Russell , no doubt , was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of <unk> into the <unk> pawnshop .
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room , a back room in the back of the As Marsellus is <unk> away , he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell &apos;s old room .
The Gimp rises .
Maynard ties The Gimp &apos;s leash to a hook on Keep an eye on this one .
The Gimp bows its head : &quot; yes . &quot;
Maynard disappears into Russell &apos;s old room .
There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds , singing in <unk> , fills the air .
Butch looks at The Gimp .
The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history From behind the door we hear country MUSIC , struggling , and : Whoa , this boy &apos;s got a bit of fight We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus .
You wanna fight ?
You wanna fight ?
Butch pauses , listens to the <unk> .
Then , in a panic , The ropes are on too tight and Butch can &apos;t break free .
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room , we hear : That &apos;s it ... that &apos;s it boy , you &apos;re Stay still ... stay still goddamn ya !
Zed <unk> , git over here and Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms .
Then , quite easily , the <unk> chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a <unk> .
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen .
The Gimp <unk> <unk> , trying to get the leash off the hook .
He tries to yell , but all that comes out are excited <unk> Butch is out of his chair , quickly <unk> three <unk> &apos;S PUNCHES to its face .
The punches knock The Gimp out , making him fall to his knees , this <unk> HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook , Butch removes the ball gag , then silently makes his way through the red curtains .
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring .
Grabbing them , he &apos;s about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly <unk> having their Butch decides for the life of him , he can &apos;t leave anybody in a situation like that .
Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to <unk> those hillbillies &apos; heads in He picks up a big <unk> hammer , then <unk> it : Not <unk> enough .
He picks up a <unk> , thinks about it for a moment , then puts it back .
Next , a large <unk> <unk> he tries on for size .
But then he spots It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall , next to a neon &quot; <unk> &apos;S <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; sign .
Butch takes the sword off the wall , removing it from its sheath .
It &apos;s a <unk> piece of steel .
It seems to <unk> in the <unk> light of the pawnshop .
Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show .
Not on your life .
It &apos;s as sharp as it gets .
This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers <unk> downstairs .
Holding the sword pointed <unk> , <unk> <unk> , he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business .
Butch quietly <unk> down the stairs leading to the dungeon .
<unk> and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell &apos;s old room .
Butch &apos;s hand comes into frame , pushing the door open .
It swings open silently , revealing the <unk> , who have <unk> Zed is now bent over Marsellus , who is bent over a wooden Maynard watches .
Both have their backs to Butch .
Maynard faces the CAMERA , grinning , while Butch comes up <unk> , <unk> , and looking like a rag doll , Marsellus , red ball gag still in mouth , opens his <unk> eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard .
His eyes widen .
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword .
Butch SCREAMS ... with one mighty SWING , SLASHES Maynard across the front , moving past him , eyes and blade now locked on Maynard stands trembling , his front <unk> open , in shock .
Butch , while never taking his eyes off Zed , <unk> the sword behind him , <unk> Maynard , then <unk> it , pointing the blade toward Zed .

Zed <unk> from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch &apos;s sword to Marsellus &apos; .

Butch steps aside , REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him , Zed is <unk> in the <unk> .

Butch leaves Russell &apos;s old room through the red curtains .
Marsellus walks over to a phone , dialing a number .
Hello Mr. Wolf , it &apos;s Marsellus .

He looks ahead and sees , parked in front of the establishment , Zed &apos;s Big <unk> <unk> with a teardrop gas <unk> that has the name &quot; GRACE &quot; on it .
He climbs aboard , takes out the keys with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog .
It RUMBLES to life , making sounds like a rocket fighting for <unk> .
Butch twists the <unk> handle and <unk> off .
Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a &quot; <unk> says , <unk> &quot; tee-shirt , singing along with MUSIC coming from a Butch drives down the street , <unk> a hot hog named &quot; GRACE . &quot;
He checks his father &apos;s watch .

Fabienne slowly approaches the <unk> <unk> .

He THROWS himself against the back wall , gun outstretched in front of him , a look of yellow fear on his face , ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door .
Then he listens to them talk .
Waiting for them isn &apos;t the <unk> move .

They &apos;re as confused at the shooter .
After looking at each other , they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man .
The Fourth Man is taken out of the <unk> by the two men &apos;s bullets who , <unk> his , HIT their marks .
He drops DEAD .
The two men lower their guns .

&quot; The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men .
Blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness .
For he is truly his brother &apos;s keeper and the finder of lost children .
And I will strike down upon thee with great who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers .
And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you . &quot;

Or is could by you &apos;re the righteous man and I &apos;m the shepherd and it &apos;s the world that &apos;s evil and selfish .

Automatics walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word .
Who &apos;s that <unk> around in the dark ?
State your business , or prepare to get Calm yourselves gentlemen , I mean you no harm .
I &apos;m simply a fellow <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two <unk> , and their Slaves , lifting the lantern up to his face .
He speaks with a slight German accent .
Good <unk> &apos;m looking for a pair of slave <unk> that go by the <unk> of The Speck Brothers .
Might that be you ?
I do .
I &apos;m Dr. King Schultz , and this Fritz , does a little bow with his head , a neat trick the doctor taught <unk> .
Are you The Speck Brothers , and did you purchase those men at The <unk> Auction ?
So , I wish to <unk> with you .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Please forgive me , it is a I &apos;ve been led to believe , is a <unk> Hello you poor devils .
Is there one among you , who was <unk> a <unk> of Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern , the second half of the slave <unk> falls off into darkness .
In the darkness a Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness , raises his Splendid !
And what &apos;s your name young , man ?
Wunderbar !
You &apos;re exactly the one I &apos;m looking for .
So tell me Django - by the way that &apos;s a amazing name - during your time at the Carrucan Plantation , did you come to know three overseers by the name of The Brittle Big John , Ellis , and little brother Raj ?
So Django , do you think you could recognize - � .
The Speck Brothers have been watching this <unk> engage their Slave in polite conversation .. <unk> a touch of <unk> .
Hey , stop talkin &apos; to him like that !
My good man , I &apos;m simply trying to ascertain Everybody calm down !
I &apos;m simply a customer I don &apos;t care , no sale .
Now off wit ya !
Don &apos;t be ridiculous , of course they &apos;re for Ace raises his rifle towards the German .
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer .
My good man , did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture , or are you pointing that weapon at me with <unk> The doctor , throws his lantern to the ground , <unk> him in The next <unk> OF <unk> we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his holster , and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face ... <unk> the <unk> dumb brother off his horse , dead in the dirt .
Before Dicky can <unk> either his rifle or his horse in the Germans SHOOTS his HORSE in the head ... .The <unk> goes down taking Dicky with him ...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky &apos;s slightly twisted leg , we Dicky lets out a bitch like scream .
The Slaves watch all this .
They &apos;ve never seen a white man kill another Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint .
Django watches in the dark , the German climb down off his horse , pick up Ace &apos;s discarded lantern , and walk over to the remaining Speck .
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast .
But I didn &apos;t want you to do anything <unk> before you had a moment to come to your senses .
<unk> LIGHTS the lantern , illuminating himself , as he stands over You goddamn son of a bitch , you killed Ace !
I only shot your brother , once he <unk> to shoot me .
And I do believe I have ... <unk> , two , three , four , five , six , seven <unk> who can <unk> to that fact .
No doubt .
Now , if you can keep your <unk> down to a minimum , I &apos;d like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django .
As I was saying , if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again , would you Now I &apos;m sure .
to you , all unshaven white men look alike .
So Django , in a crowd of unshaven white men , can you <unk> and positively point out The Brittle Brothers ?
We &apos;re in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation .
It &apos;s PISSING RAIN outside .
Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda , when she stops letting out a <unk> .
The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS are outside peeking in through the window .
They BURST in through the front door .
<unk> to the <unk> , they rodeo bull their way into the shack , and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement .
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to <unk> , they run their wet white hands down her <unk> leg .. .they <unk> his ass .. .they <unk> her tit . . .they bring a belt across Django &apos;s <unk> to make him fuck faster . . <unk> they yank him off , as BIG JOHN climbs on top of Broomhilda .. the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their <unk> , and make him sit in the corner , while they finish with his wife .
<unk> American !
So Mr.Speck , how much for Yes , unless you find a talented physician very quickly , I &apos;m afraid that will be the .
end result .
But back to business , how much Don &apos;t be silly .
How much for Django ?
Oh come now , I may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does , but neither was I born yesterday .
The .
good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket .
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked up at The Greenville Slave Auction , it says that the going <unk> for African flesh &apos; - in <unk> a field nigger - _ is sixty to eighty dollars .
Now handsome no doubt as Django is , technically , he is a field .
nigger .
Which according to &quot; this pamphlet here - and why would they lie - puts his price at eighty dollars .
So in light of that , how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket , and takes out a one hundred dollar bill , two <unk> and a <unk> .
And since your late brother .
won &apos;t be using it anymore , I &apos;d like to purchase his nag .
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his .
pocket , and tosses it on Dicky &apos;s body .
He bends down and , puts the paper <unk> the saddle bags on Dicky &apos;s dead horse .
<unk> hands in there , he roots around and finds the keys <unk> leg irons .
He unlocks Django &apos;s leg irons .
There you go Django , .
Give your ankles a good rubbing , then get up on that horse .
Also , if I was you , I &apos;d take that winter coat the dear <unk> Speck left behind .
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver .
Puts on the warm jacket over his bare back , and climbs up on Ace Specks horse .
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground .
Mr.Speck , I am afraid I will <unk> a bill of sale .
Do you have one ?
He says , removing a notebook from his pocket ; I thought not .
No worries , I come prepared .
This will serve <unk> as a bill of sale .
Django is spelled with a silent &quot; D &quot; , He writes it in his book with a silent &quot; D &quot; , then stops to admire the Yes , that does add a little character .
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down under his horse , and hands him the notebook and pen .
If you &apos;d be so kind Speck , as to make your The .
Hillbilly <unk> in the German gentleman &apos;s face .
The good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief .
Then takes out a pocket knife .
And whispers something that can &apos;t be heard in the slavers ear .
He signs the bill of sale .
Mr.Speck , I would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you , but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired .
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz , and looks to the six Slaves , in Now as to you poor devils .
He tosses to <unk> <unk> the keys to the <unk> .
So as <unk> it , when it comes to the subject of what to do next , you gentlemen have two choices .
One , once I &apos;m gone , you lift that beast off the remaining Speck , then carry him to the <unk> town .
Which would be at least <unk> miles back the way you came .
<unk> , you <unk> yourselves , take that rifle over there . . <unk> a bullet in his head , bury the two of them deep , and make your way to a more <unk> area of the country .
He &apos;s just about ready to ride off , when the good doctor adds ; Oh , and on the off chance that there &apos;s the North Star is THAT ONE .
<unk> .
He looks to Django , who doesn &apos;t know how to start his horse .
Just give him a little kick .
Django does , and the horse responds by moving .
The <unk> BREAKS on a western <unk> .
The two men ride their horses silently , horse hooves <unk> among the rocks .
Django wears Specks winter coat , with one of Dr.Schultz &apos;s white button down dress shirts underneath it .
As they ride through the <unk> scene ...
So , Django , what do you intend to name him ?
No it ain &apos;t , it &apos;s your horse .
I &apos;m just riding Well , technically , yes - Wait a minute - technically not .
If it &apos;s my horse , I can give it to you , and as of now , I &apos;m doing such .
Django , you &apos;re now the proud owner of a horse , I can &apos;t <unk> no horse .
I can &apos;t put no horse They ride a bit longer in silence .. .the good doctor <unk> himself ...
So ... . now that that &apos;s settled ... . what do you intend to name it ?
Half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name .
For instance my steed is named Fritz .
He &apos;s <unk> , ornery , and <unk> to a bad disposition , but I Anyway , the name of one &apos;s steed , isn &apos;t something one does lightly .
So once you &apos;ve thought about it for awhile - - I dunno , Tony the horse .
Oh , you mean you want to name your horse Yeah .
That &apos;s what you jus &apos; asked me , right ?
When you &apos;re right you &apos;re right , indeed I did .
I gotta tell ya ?
You didn &apos;t tell me I gotta As they continue to <unk> , they start heading downhill toward a western town .
They pass by a sign that says ; &quot; <unk> TO <unk> , Well I &apos;m naturally curious , of course , but there &apos;s no reason you <unk> tell me .
In fact an air of <unk> adds a dash of panache to any steed .
And I do believe Tony wears it well .
Good job Django , well done .
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up , Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz and Tony through the main street of town .. Daughtrey looks like a million western towns we &apos;ve seen before in movies .
But to the TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey , Django and the German don &apos;t look like a They never seen a nigger on a horse before .
What &apos;s this bizarre <unk> they have Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon , and dismounts .
Django has a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him , but it gets done .
Dr.Schultz keeps <unk> The Slave with questions .
So what other <unk> <unk> are you people As per usual with this white man , Django thinks ; &quot; What &quot; ?
I &apos;m just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do , and what you can &apos;t do , and if you can &apos;t do it , why can &apos;t you do it ?
Like for instance , what if we were to walk in this saloon here , sit down at a table , order a drink , and drink it ?
Would the authorities frown on that ?
What part would they find the most <unk> ?
All of it .
I can &apos;t be walkin &apos; in no saloon .
I can &apos;t be sittin &apos; my ass on no chair , at no table .
I can &apos;t be drinkin &apos; no drink .
And I definitely can &apos;t be <unk> &apos; no drink , with no white man , in public .
So if you and I did those things , that would be <unk> enough of a <unk> to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff ?
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff .
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance .
Well in that case Django , after you .
Whoa - I ain &apos;t <unk> , I can &apos;t go in there .
Django you &apos;re going to have to learn to trust me , and as the man said ; &quot; There &apos;s no time He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the <unk> of the The nervous black slave and the confident German <unk> walk into the The <unk> <unk> is high up on a chair placed high up on a table , to change a candle in the <unk> chandelier .
His back is turned Good morning <unk> keeper , two <unk> for two It &apos; , s still pretty early , we won &apos;t be open for about a hour .
But by then we &apos;ll be He turns around and sees them .
Whoa !
What the hell you think you doin &apos; boy , It &apos;s about five minutes later , and the Saloon Keeper comes running out of the bar to get the Sheriff .
When Dr.Schultz , sitting at a table with the young Django , calls ; Inn keeper !
Remember , get the sheriff , not the marshall .
This wouldn &apos;t be the <unk> on what I assume is a simple county <unk> , and that would fall under the <unk> of the The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon .
It looks like we must act as our own bartender .
The German stands up , and <unk> the bar , and pours two beer &apos;s from the <unk> into mugs .
Django remains seated , and after a beat , asks ; This makes the doctor laugh , as he pours the beer &apos;s .
I haven &apos;t <unk> <unk> in five years - Not to say once I know you better , I wouldn &apos;t like to get a look at that mouth - I &apos;m sure it &apos;s a disaster - But these days I practice a new <unk> ... . Bounty Hunter .
This gets no reaction from Django .
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is ?
The Black Man shakes his head , no .
As the good doctor , walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer , Well the way the slave trade <unk> in human lives for cash , a bounty hunter , The state places a bounty on a man &apos;s head .
I track that man , I find that man , I kill that man .
After I &apos;ve killed him , I transport that man &apos;s corpse back to the authorities - and sometimes that &apos;s easier said then done .
I show that corpse to the authorities - <unk> , yes indeed , I have truly killed him - At which point , the authorities pay me The two men touch glasses , and take a drink .
You kill people and they give you a reward ?
<unk> .
A few Mexicans .
Couple <unk> .
<unk> they are , bigger the reward .
Which brings me to you , and I must admit I &apos;m at a bit of a <unk> when it comes to you .
On one hand , I despise slavery .
On the other hand , I need your help , and if you &apos;re not in a position to refuse , all the better .
So for the time being , I &apos;m going to make this slave <unk> Still ... . having said that , .I feel guilty .
So ...
I &apos;d like the two of us to enter into an agreement .
I &apos;m looking for The Brittle Brothers , however in this endeavor I &apos;m at a slight <unk> , in so far as , I don &apos;t know what they look like .
But you do ... <unk> &apos;cha ?
Django , back at The Carrucan Plantation , held down by Roger and Ellis Brittle , as Big John BURNS the &quot; r &quot; into his cheek with a <unk> IRON .
I know what they look like , all right .
Good .
So , here &apos;s my agreement .
You <unk> with me till we find them - I hear at least two of them are <unk> up in Gatlinburg , but I don &apos;t know where .
That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find them .
And when we find them , you point them out , and I kill them .
You do that , I agree to give you your freedom ... . twenty-five dollars per dollars ... . your horse , Tony even though I &apos;ve already gave him to you -- but once the final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust , I &apos;ll buy you a new saddle , and a new suit of clothes , handsome cowboy hat Dr.Schultz &apos;s eyes go to the saloon window .
And as if on cue ... . here comes the sheriff .
We see the sheriff , BILL <unk> , walk towards the saloon cradling a Winchester .
Some TOWNSPEOPLE stand around to watch .
A.
YOUNG BOY leads a <unk> of <unk> <unk> through town .
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street .
Okay boys , fun &apos;s over , come on out .
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch .
As they do , The Sheriff says ; Now why y &apos;all wanna come into my town , start trouble , and scare all these nice people ?
You ain &apos;t got nothin &apos; better to do , then to come into Bill <unk> town From his top step on the porch , Dr. King Schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff , as if to shake it ... : .
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz &apos;s hand from a metal sliding <unk> concealed under his jacket sleeve .
Once in hand , the dentist FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp .
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound .
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly <unk> , and <unk> over in the As Schultz walks down the porch steps , to the fallen sheriff , <unk> his tiny pop shooter , a PEDESTRIAN yells out ; What did you jus &apos; do to our sheriff ?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man &apos;s In the background , ONE WOMAN <unk> .
The Boy and his <unk> scatter .
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper , across the street .
Now you can go get the marshall .
<unk> <unk> TATUM snaps the <unk> OF Daughtrey to attention .
<unk> that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon .
And I want six men and six Winchesters behind it .
And I want two men with two rifles on this roof , and two men with two rifles on that roof , with all barrels pointed at that front door .
And somebody git poor Bill <unk> with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon .
The Marshall <unk> the buckboard being moved into place .
The last <unk> on the rooftop takes his position .
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a <unk> little saloon number .
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player .
A terrified Django , who &apos;s sure his new master is a <unk> who &apos;s going to get them both killed , peeks out the closed curtains Dr.Schultz &apos;s suit coat sits draped over a chair .
All of his weapons , including his metal sliding <unk> Derringer contraption , lie on a table .
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest .
I think they <unk> &apos; why you playin &apos; A buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front , now they hidin &apos; behind it with guns .
And a buncha other white folks are up on the roof , with rifles pointed Damn , they got that <unk> fast .
Is the If the one I think is <unk> is the What makes you think he &apos;s the marshall ?
Cause he &apos;s the one ready to say somethin &apos; .
We got eleven Winchesters on every way outta that <unk> &apos; !
You got once chance git outta this alive !
You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head , and I mean , right now !
First things first !
Is this the marshall I have the pleasure of <unk> ?
Yes it is , this is <unk> Marshall <unk> Tatum .
Wunderbar !
So marshall , I have <unk> myself of all weapons , and just as you have <unk> , I &apos;m ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head .
I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of The United States of America , I shant be shot down in the street , by either you or your deputies , before I &apos;ve had my day in court .
You mean like you did our sheriff ?
Shot &apos; em down like a dog in the street !
Yes , that &apos;s exactly what I mean !
Do I have your word as a <unk> not to shoot me down like a dog in the street ?
Well , as much as we &apos;d all enjoy seein &apos; somethin &apos; like that , ain &apos;t nobody gonna cheat the <unk> in my town !
They &apos;re a little tense out there .
So don &apos;t make any quick movements , and let me do Django looks at him like , &quot; as if ... &quot; A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon .
Outside of range , the <unk> <unk> watches the stand off .
The saloon doors open , and Dr.Schultz and Django , hands raised , step Yes indeed we are .
Marshall Tatum , may I address you , your deputies , and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey , as to the My name is Dr.King Schultz .
And like yourself , marshall , I am a servant of the court .
The man lying dead in the dirt , who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to <unk> as their sheriff , who went by the name of Bill Sharp , is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard <unk> , with a price on his head of two hundred dollars .
That &apos;s two hundred dollars , dead I &apos; <unk> aware this is probably disconcerting news .
But I &apos;m willing to <unk> this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years .
I know this because .
three years ago he was <unk> <unk> from , The <unk>
<unk> <unk> Company of In my possession .
is a warrant made out by circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin Texas .
You are <unk> to wire him .
He will back up who I am , and who your The <unk> of the town with rifles , begin <unk> looks .
Then Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace .
In other words marshall , you owe me Django and Dr.Schultz , who by now have ridden quite a few miles together , ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside , on the way to Gatlinburg .
Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his <unk> <unk> grey business suits , and Django is still dressed in his slave pants , Schultz &apos;s button down dress shirt , and Ace Speck &apos;s winter coat .
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on <unk> feet .
One needs a plan , son .
These are brutal times .
A man who <unk> , is a man with a plan .
A man who thrives , is a man with a good plan .
So , having said that , what &apos;s Well , after this Brittle business is behind us , you &apos;ll be a free man , with a horse , and seventy five dollars in your back pocket .
Find my wife , and buy her freedom .
Django , I had no idea you were a married man .
Do most slaves take the institution of I dunno .
They put us in different <unk> , and sent <unk> to The Greenville Slave Auction .
She got sold two days &apos; fore me .
But I don &apos;t know who to .
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky .
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece .
Django chews on it .
As he chews , So your plan is to <unk> your wife , and purchase <unk> ?
Only you don &apos;t know A <unk> Django nods his head , yes .
Dr.Schultz , takes a big bite of jerky , chews for a &quot; moment <unk> Well that shouldn &apos;t be all that difficult .
So how long ago did all this happen ?
and <unk> at The Greenville Slave The bad part about slavery being a business , is it &apos;s <unk> .
The good part about it being a business is , they keep records .
Somewhere in Greenville there &apos;s a book with your wife &apos;s name in it , and the name of the customer who bought her , and more then likely their address .
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts .
Still , <unk> dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice <unk> steak , but it &apos;s not going to get you very far in Greenville .
Not to mention a slave auction town in Mississippi isn &apos;t the <unk> place you could Yes you will .
But say you show them to some <unk> , and they take them from you and I &apos;m not saying they would , but they could .
They do that I &apos;ll kill &apos; em .
Great !
Now you get hung for killin &apos; a white man .
The point being is the place , is just Well I gotta go , when do I go ?
<unk> and wet big city <unk> .
We &apos;re in the back of a STORE that .
sells <unk> / HOUSE NIGGER <unk> .
Django comes <unk> out of the stores back door .
He &apos;s very <unk> .
One glance at the outfit he &apos;s is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit , that wouldn &apos;t be out of place in the court of <unk> <unk> at Django , you have to , it &apos;s part of &quot; The <unk> &quot; .
You &apos;re playing a character .
Your character is The Valet .
This is what The Valet wears .
Remember what I told you .
During the act , We see Dr. Schultz , riding slightly in front of Django , dressed in his blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit , as they enter the property of BENNETT MANOR , a plantation in Gatlinburg , Tennessee .
Django leads a <unk> horse , behind him and Tony .
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of Bennett Manor , alongside the cotton fields , all the SLAVES stop picking cotton , and straighten their bent backs up to stare in The <unk> of Bennett Manor , <unk> &quot; BIG <unk> &quot; BENNETT , dressed in a fancy <unk> suit of the day , emerges from the double doors of the mansion , and stands on the top steps , hands on <unk> , watching the white man and black man move from the background to the <unk> .
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields , the <unk> of the slave <unk> of Bennett Manor is <unk> <unk> , fourteen to <unk> , referred to as , &quot; PONY &apos;S &quot; .
The biggest money making crop of this farm , after cotton .
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django , bring Fritz and Tony to a stop in front of Bennett Manor , they &apos;ve drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES , BENNETT FAMILY <unk> , and WHITE WORKERS .
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won &apos;t be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse .
It &apos;s against the law for niggers to ride This is my valet , and my valet doesn &apos;t walk .
His name is Django , he &apos;s a free man , and he can ride what he <unk> .
Not on <unk> , around my niggers My good sir , <unk> we got off on the wrong boot .
Allow me to <unk> this bell .
My name is Dr.King Schultz , this is my valet , Django , and these are our horses , This makes the pretty PONY &apos;S surrounding Bennett , giggle .
Mr. Bennett , I &apos;ve been lead to believe you are a gentleman , and a business man .
And it is in these <unk> that we &apos;ve ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk I wish to purchase one of your You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee , to buy one of my nigger gals , Well what if I say , I don &apos;t like you , or your fancy pants .
nigger , and I wouldn &apos;t sell you a <unk> damn - what &apos;cha gotta Mr. Bennett , if you are the business man , I &apos;ve been led to believe you to be , I have five thousand things I might say , i This gets everybody &apos;s attention , not least of all Spencer Bennett .
C &apos;mon inside , get yourself something &apos; cool The <unk> bounty hunter , dismounts his steed , as does Django .
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor .
Maybe while we discuss business , you could <unk> one of your <unk> black <unk> to escort Django here around A pretty , <unk> , sweet <unk> , twenty-two year old slave gal named Betina sugar , take Django around the grounds .
Show &apos; em all the pretty stuff .
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice , and says to the plantation owner ; Mr. Bennett , I must remind , you , Django is a free man .
He <unk> be treated like a slave .
<unk> the <unk> of good taste , he must be treated as an <unk> of myself .
Django isn &apos;t a slave .
Django is a free man .
Do you understand ?
You &apos;re not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here , cause he ain &apos;t like any of these other niggers around here .
Ya got it ?
Ya want I should treat &apos; em like white No that &apos;s not what I said .
Then I don &apos;t know what &apos;cha want Big Daddy .
What &apos;s the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass ?
His mama works at the <unk> yard ?
He comes by and fixes the winda &apos;s when we have a problem ?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in ; Yeah , that &apos;s the boy &apos;s name , Jerry .
Well that &apos;s it then ... just treat &apos; em <unk> from the big house , Betina gives Django a <unk> of the grounds .
Her in her slave get up , complete with handkerchief on her head , and him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit , are quite the pair .
She eyeballs him <unk> up and down .
Didn &apos;t you hear him tell ya , I ain &apos;t no slave .
You mean you wanna dress like that ?
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking I &apos;ve been <unk> by those who should know , the most exquisite African flesh in the state of Tennessee is <unk> right here on your land .
And from the look of these black <unk> , my <unk> weren &apos;t wrong .
Oh I got my share of , coal blacks , horse faces , and <unk> mouth bitches out in the field .
But the <unk> share of my lady Well that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking for , a show pony for young Django .
So the only question that remains is , do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars ?
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds .
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it , in the background .
Betina , come over here , I need to ask He moves her by the tree for more privacy .
Betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all <unk> , and she couldn &apos;t be less interested .
I &apos;m lookin &apos; for three white men .
Three Yes , Brittle .
John Brittle .
Ellis Brittle .
And Roger Brittle , sometimes called , Little Raj .
They could be <unk> &apos; a different name .
They woulda &apos; come to the plantation in Can you point one of &apos; em out to me ?
Well ones over in that field .
She points to the cotton field , at a <unk> on top of a horse , whip in hand , eyeing the blacks at his mercy .
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it , and takes out a shiny brass <unk> , the type a sea <unk> might use .
Obviously a prop from <unk>
He slides it open , places it against his eye , and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton Astride his nag , the filthy hillbilly , who calls himself <unk> , but who Django knows to be <unk> BRITTLE , looks on , oblivious to Django &apos;s He remembers Ellis Brittle <unk> a &quot; r &quot; into Broomhilda &apos;s cheek with a Is that who you lookin &apos; for ?
He folds the <unk> back up , and puts it back in his purse .

Django does the same with his pistol .

The German carries a <unk> <unk> .
But I &apos;m serious son , Greenville is just too dangerous for you to go fucking around there .
You &apos;re a <unk> , slave , you should be in New York .
You shouldn &apos;t be in Greenville , you shouldn &apos;t even be forty miles on any side of Greenville . , You shouldn &apos;t be anywhere in Mississippi .
She &apos;s my wife , it &apos;s my job to look after her .
If Greenville &apos;s where I gotta go to find out where she went , then I gotta go .
Now you were sayin &apos; where I gotta go first ?
There <unk> be some sort of records office .
You know when she was sold , you know where she came from , the Carrucan Plantation , and you know her name ... . what is her name ?
Now Django reacts , &quot; How did he know that ?
Yeah , how did you know ?
She wasn &apos;t born on The Carrucan Plantation .
She was raised by a German mistress , The Von <unk> .
She can Yeah , when she was little her mistress taught her so she &apos;d have somebody to talk German with .
So let me get this straight , your slave wife speaks German , and her name is This looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic .
What &apos;d ya say , here ?
The two men sit on a <unk> with a nice picnic spread spread out .
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the <unk> cut off , and drinks a How did you know Broomhilda &apos;s first masters Broomhilda is a German name .
If they named her , it stands to reason they &apos;d be German .
<unk> gals where you from named Broomhilda ?
No , not so much .
Broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of Really ?
There &apos;s a story &apos; bout Broomhilda ?
Every German knows that story .
Would you Well Broomhilda was a <unk> .
She was the daughter of <unk> , the god of all gods .
Anyway , her father is really mad at her .
I don &apos;t exactly remember .
I think she <unk> him in some way .
So at first he &apos;s just going to <unk> ... . what does that mean ?
Yes it is , and like most fathers , given a little time , he calms down a bit .
He &apos;s still mad at her .
He still wants to <unk> her .
Just not ... . blow her up .
So instead what he does , is he puts her high on top of a mountain .
It &apos;s a German legend , there &apos;s always going to be a mountain in there somewhere .
So , he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain .
And .
then he surrounds her in circle of <unk> .
And there Broomhilda shall remain , unless a hero <unk> brave enough to save her .
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks , he &apos;s beginning to realize something he wasn &apos;t aware of when the conversation started .
Yes Django , as a matter he does .
A fella Yes he does , and quite <unk> , so .
Now true , he is <unk> in his <unk> by a truly , truly , <unk> sword , still , having said that , Sigfried <unk> over all of his <unk> not just due to his sword , but due to his courage .
He <unk> the mountain , because he &apos;s not afraid of it .
He defeats the dragon , because After that last line of dialogue ... .the two men just let a moment pass as they <unk> on their sandwiches .
I think I &apos;m just starting to realize that .
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot , as he thinks about what he &apos;s going to say next .
Look Django , I don &apos;t doubt one day you will save your lady love .
But I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t let you go to Greenville in a good conscious .
Let me ask you a question , how do you like Kill white folks , and they pay ya ?
I hafta admit , we make a good team .
But I <unk> you were mad at me for killin &apos; Yes , on that occasion , you were a <unk> <unk> .
But normally , that &apos;s a good thing .
How &apos;d you like to partner up for You be my deputy , for real this time .
A lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs .
Some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece .
With one man , anything over three men is a risk .
But with a partner ?
<unk> cross fire ?
It &apos;s fish in a. barrel .
A lot of these gangs hold up in the <unk> Yes .
You work with me through the winter , till the snow melts .
I give you a third of my bounties .
And while we &apos;re together , I &apos;ll teach you a few things you &apos;re going Can you teach me how to make Tony do that head bow thing that Fritz can do ?
That among other things .
We make some money this winter , when the snow melts , I &apos;ll take you to Greenville myself , and we &apos;ll find where they sent your wife .
I &apos;m pretty good at finding people .
Is it a deal ?
No white man has ever done anything for Django , just to him .
So Why you care what happens to me ?
Why you care if I find my wife ?
Well <unk> , I &apos;ve never given anybody their freedom before .
And now that I have , I feel <unk> responsible for you .
You &apos;re just not ready to go off on your own , it &apos;s that simple .
You &apos;re too green , you &apos;ll get hurt .
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried , .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
As a German , I &apos;m obliged to help you on your quest to What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and Schultz partner up as bounty hunters .
Schultz wears his normal <unk> .
Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket , unless it &apos;s really cold , which a lot of this <unk> is .
Then he still wears Ace Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes .
A <unk> to be <unk> , where Dr.Schultz teaches Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip .
By the end of the scene , after trial and error , we see Django &apos;s going We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill .
Tony and Fritz have been left tied up downhill .
Django leads a extra body HORSE ( named <unk> ) behind him .
Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in &apos; a long case .
They get to the top of the hill .
It overlooks a small <unk> .
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow , and his <unk> <unk> OLD SON helping him by leading the horse forward .
On top of their perch on the hill top , Dr.Schultz says ; Keep down or he &apos;ll see you .
Well since we came here to kill &apos; em , he What ?
The little man <unk> &apos; that plow ?
That little man pushing that plow , is Smitty Bacall .
No .
Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber who &apos;s hiding out as a <unk> , because there &apos;s a seven thousand dollar bounty on He hands Django the scope rifle case .
And he &apos;s all yours my boy .
DJANGO lays on his belly , with the <unk> <unk> up to his eye .

Don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m not mad at you .
Take out Smitty Bacall &apos;s handbill .
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants .
<unk> it aloud .
Consider it today &apos;s lesson .
&quot; Wanted , dead or alive .
Smitty Bacall and The Smitty Bacall Gang .
For murder and for Smitty Bacall .
One thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members .
<unk> members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as follows , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Well done .
Bravo .
THAT is who Smitty Bacall is .
If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty-two , they would never of printed that .
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob <unk> , and he didn &apos;t mind killing people to do it .
You want to save your wife by doing what I do ?
This is what I do .
I kill people , and sell their <unk> for cash .
His corpse Now quit your <unk> and shoot him .
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down .
The Young Boy doesn &apos;t know what happened at first .
Then he figures <unk> his father was just shot .
He goes to him in the dirt .
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill .
It &apos;s good luck .
You always keep the They begin walking down the hill , to collect Smitty Bacall &apos;s body , leading the extra body horse behind them .
As they walk down hill , they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall &apos;s <unk> cradling his dying <unk> his arms , the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies .
See , they &apos;re having a tender little father son moment now .
No doubt the most <unk> one It &apos;s now full on snowy winter in the hills .
Django practices his quick draw against a <unk> he &apos;s built .
He sticks a <unk> in it , so the bottom of the bottle is where the <unk> &apos;s I think it &apos;s safe to say you &apos;re faster then A outlaw gang known as The <unk> - <unk> <unk> ride through a snowy forest at night .
When all five men and their Horses , are SHOT up in a tree , FIRING DOWN ON them .
The <unk> continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down the main street of town , pulling poor <unk> who &apos;s <unk> <unk> DOWN The local SHERIFF , <unk> <unk> , watches the two men ride up , he knows them .
Doctor and Django , how the hell are ya , and who the hell ya got there ?
Who the hell &apos;s The Wilson - Lowe Gang ?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket , and hands it down to the friendly peace officer .
Bad Chuck Wilson , and <unk> <unk> Lowe .
Just leave &apos; em out here , they ain &apos;t going nowhere .
And if &apos;in they do , god must love &apos; em , so who are we to say .
Come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee .
The snow <unk> bounty hunters come inside the <unk> office .
They exchange <unk> about the weather as the Sheriff pours them coffee .
After the two <unk> gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid , they get down to business .
As Schultz and <unk> discuss the bounties , Django reads the <unk> aloud from off the wall .
On the third one he reads , <unk> <unk> , and a two thousand dollar bounty , Django RIPS IT off the wall .
As the winter has <unk> , we see they &apos;ve become a genuine bounty <unk> team .
And Django , a genuine bounty hunter .
The snow has <unk> , and it &apos;s SPRING .
And inside of this <unk> Django practices his fast draw against five men ... <unk> Schultz throwing FIVE <unk> in the air ... DJANGO <unk> FAST shoots three coins , FIRES again hitting another , then falls to the ground to get the fifth .
He looks up from the ground at Schultz .
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground , he says ; He holds out his fist , opens his hand , the coins lay in his palm .
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center .
He drops them on Still think I &apos;m too green for Greenville ?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe , sticks it in his mouth and says ; He lights a match , then lights the pipe , puffing as he says ; Greenville ready for you , that I &apos;m not so What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a <unk> of slavery .
Django , in his green jacket , in his cowboy hat , on top of his steed Tony , with his gun hanging from his hip , has become his own man .
He &apos;s not a slave anymore .
He &apos;s a bounty hunter .
ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE <unk> AT A TIME STYLE ( <unk> &quot; Rocky &quot; and The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the horse hooves , and wagon wheels , and slave feet have to <unk> through to get from one end of the town to the other .
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town , and slosh their horses in the mud , , down the main street of Greenville Mississippi .
The buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around .
BLACK MEN , WOMEN , and CHILDREN in <unk> are everywhere you look .
LINES OF <unk> SLAVES being <unk> one way or the other , move through the muddy streets of Greenville .
WHITE MEN on horses move them <unk> filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES , and pretty <unk> , <unk> by WHITE MEN roll through the street .
A YOUNG WHITE BOY , a shepherd , leads a bunch of SLAVE CHILDREN through town .
A SHEPHERD &apos;S DOG , <unk> HIM OUT BY <unk> <unk> slave <unk> take place on almost every block .
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen : Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market , where human beings sell other human beings , with <unk> and a little bit of shock .
Django is neither <unk> or .
shocked , he knows first hand how As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds , he looks <unk> the BLACK MEN half dressed : in chains .
He <unk> HIMSELF with his six Other <unk> from earlier , being walked through the mud of Main Street by The Speck Brothers .
On that day he might as well of been a steer .

Django sees the towns railroad depot , and across from it a huge SLAVE PEN , like a <unk> <unk> .
At the moment there &apos;s no train in the depot .
The <unk> , at a earlier time , pulling into the depot .
<unk> a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES , Django watches the train pull into the station , from inside the wooden <unk> of the boxcar .

You should see it from the other side .
Frankly , I don &apos;t know if I could endure this .
You &apos;d be surprised what you can endure .
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office , lined with books .
We watch through the store front window , the black man and white man enter , and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a <unk> looking <unk> <unk> <unk> .
As Schultz starts his <unk> with words routine ... .
The CAMERA <unk> TO BLACK .
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen , to get a better last look of Broomhilda .
Broomhilda , as before is walked by in the distance .
Then , as before Django loses sight of her .
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO WHITE MALE <unk> .
Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud , and the leg irons <unk> her ankles .
Up until now everything you &apos;ve ever seen of Broomhilda , has only been in Django &apos;s Spaghetti Western <unk> .
In other words , from his perspective , and memory .
This is the , only time the story will shift to Broomhilda &apos;s perspective .
The strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and <unk> , and wagon wheels and horse <unk> of Main Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django was sold in at the beginning .
Instead She &apos;s just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon .
Her <unk> starts his pitch on the <unk> or so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction .

The Seller <unk> the crowd , that niggers don &apos;t feel pain like white folks , and it only makes the women more gentle .

Broomhilda notices that .
And makes more eye contact with Scotty .
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid .
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack .
On that day , eight months ago , the auction was won by <unk> Harmony , as a birthday present for his fat boy son Scotty .
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new <unk> .
Later they leave for the Harmony house .
Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard .
He hands her a little white bag .
She opens the bag , <unk> of many colors sit in it .
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth .
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans .
The buckboard makes its way down a country road .
Broomhilda in the back , and Scotty driving the wagon .
Scotty bought her , but he &apos;s too scared to talk to her .
Broomhilda &apos;s muddy bare feet <unk> off the wagon .
She &apos;s beginning to realize the young master is the shy type .
I &apos;m lonely back here .
Can I come on up with you on that seat so we can talk ?
She climbs into the driver &apos;s seat .
In more ways then one .
A nice two story southern house .
Very nice , but hardly a plantation .
The <unk> &apos;s FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES .
Broomhilda will be the fifth .
The buckboard pulls up to the front of the house .
Scotty &apos;s mother , , waits to meet her son , and The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her ; Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen .
The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES that were in , there are chased out by the boss lady .
Mrs.Harmony grabs Broomhilda by the wrist , and tells her ; I want to have a word with you , <unk> .
You met my boy Scotty .
You can tell ain &apos;t no white girl gonna fool with him .
And if they do fool with him , they fool with him for the wrong reason .
Boy &apos;s twenty four , he still ain &apos;t a man yet .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
Be nice to him .
He &apos;s a very sweet boy .

Basically The Harmony &apos;s bought a slave bride for young master Scotty that day .
And the two kids had a nice time playing We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching <unk> in <unk> <unk> in At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together .
At night in Scotty &apos;s bed , while the young man lay fast asleep , Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of <unk> LIGHTNING BUGS .
As Scotty &apos;s sort of <unk> <unk> , if no visitors were about , Broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table .
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and And pretty soon she was adopted into a The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing <unk> in the front yard .
After dinner , Mrs.Harmony <unk> the family by playing the piano .
Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a <unk> .
Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour .
Broomhilda having sex with Scotty , baby talking with him , talking him through it , making him feel loved and secure .
After three months of this <unk> , Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for drive through the Main Street of Greenville , dressed to the nines , in a fancy <unk> .
Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress , complete with white lace gloves , fancy ladies hat , and white parasol .
Scotty , very proud of his pretty Pony , is dressed in a fashion best White masters would take their pretty Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic how bad the other slaves had it , always made the <unk> Ponys appreciate their privilege holding her parasol , looking like a black <unk> <unk> , watches the OTHER SLAVES <unk> by in the mud .

Broomhilda and Scotty , and their <unk> , move into the fancy hotel lobby , and rent a room at the front desk .
Scotty signs his name .

And if <unk> you means I go to hell ... . Well then hello <unk>
That was actually kind of funny .

She puts her hand on his .
Then ... speak of the devil and the devil Hello , my name is Calvin Candie , I own The Cleopatra Club .
And I would just like yourselves to my favorite place on earth .
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin .

Scotty , as per usual , is <unk> .
How long have you been a member ?
Well our little private <unk> <unk> your <unk> .

She tries to <unk> they should stay where they are .
He brushes her off We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple , and they Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named <unk> , whose dress is a little more revealing then the others .
They drink and talk , and the White Men have a forced good time .
But Calvin Candie can &apos;t hide his sinister side from Broomhilda , and it keeps her uncomfortable , until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed .
Scotty &apos;s having such a good time with his fancy friends he <unk> to stay behind .
<unk> leaves in a bit of a huff , due to Scotty &apos;s <unk> .
If these <unk> white men weren &apos;t around making Scotty feel so <unk> <unk> , he &apos;d never dismiss her that way .
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club , across the street , to the hotel .
After <unk> herself , she walked across the street to her hotel room .
She got her white dress dirty in the mud , but she didn &apos;t care , the night was ruined anyway .
Some romantic weekend .
Wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her .
She &apos;ll fix his fat ass .
Wait till he asks her to <unk> his back next time .

Back at The Cleopatra Club , as the night wore on , Calvin Candie suggested &apos;a friendly card game .
As the game wore on , it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony .
Luckily for him , Scotty was <unk> inside straight .
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him .

This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night .
Scotty doesn &apos;t intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his pot , especially with him holding an inside straight .
I would think a southern gentleman of such <unk> as yourself , wouldn &apos;t have to resort to buying a pot in his own club .
Calvin writes on a piece of paper , then <unk> &apos;in the pot .
Scotty takes the piece of paper , &quot; What &apos;s this ? &quot;

Calvin climbs down off of his horse , and walks to the captured runaway But the fact remains , I pay five hundred dollars , I want five fights .
So what about my five hundred dollars ?
You gonna This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach .
Not Django ... . he &apos;s seen this little <unk> play out many times before .
The three returning mandingos , Rodney , Chicken Charly , and Chester , watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away .
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie &apos;s <unk> of D &apos;Artagnan to know what to expect from their new home .
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like , poor You even know what <unk> means ?
Including Django &apos;s , whose eyes narrow at the doctor .

As we HEAR the <unk> ... Django , who expected nothing less and has seen worse , doesn &apos;t blink as the runaway slave is torn to <unk> by <unk> teeth ...
The other <unk> are scared sick at what they see .
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on .
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before , and he Calvin , without <unk> , <unk> his eyes toward Dr.Schultz , then back Your boss looks a little green around the <unk> for a blood sport like As D &apos;Artagnan &apos;s SCREAMS and Marsha &apos;s <unk> continue OFF SCREEN .

Cause as of now , if he &apos;s a <unk> , I &apos; <unk> nothing , Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django , climbs up on his horse , then looks at the black man .
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D &apos;Artagnan The caravan starts to approach Candyland .
Calvin Candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi .
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton , and fields of SLAVES The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Prison , a Mexican prison in a <unk> <unk> ... . <unk> is very beautiful .
The fields of cotton , the way the trees hang green <unk> over everything .
It &apos;s full of nature and <unk> <unk> colors , and a <unk> hot sun to see it all in .
One of the <unk> in the field , <unk> , looks up , and sees Django in his cool green <unk> jacket , badass cowboy hat , on top of Tony .
He <unk> the shoulder of another cotton <unk> , and points out All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field , straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse .
Django looks back matching their stare .
The caravan rolls through the shack / <unk> village the slaves live in .
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES <unk> to attention , and bow as Monsieur Candie rides past .
A <unk> among his <unk> , a PATRON with his <unk> , a <unk> amongst his CHILDREN , a SHEPHERD <unk> playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse .
Candie calls the kids by name , takes out a bag of jelly beans , and The Kids <unk> in the dirt for the bright <unk> <unk> .
This is Calvin Candie in his <unk> , at his <unk> .
The <unk> moves from the slave village to the White <unk> the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds .
Other then the switch of white faces for black , it &apos;s pretty much the And they too see Django ... . <unk> !
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation , or The Big House as everyone calls it .
To the left of the Big House is big wooden <unk> built for his <unk> All the HOUSE SLAVES ( the <unk> slaves that work for the Candie family in the Big House ) , and WHITE WORKERS ( overseers and <unk> farm hands ) come out to greet the caravan .
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie , who naturally leads the <unk> , as if he &apos;s Alexander The Great returning from the <unk> .

All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses , a older one , and two tough looking younger ones .
The <unk> one is the Cap &apos;t of the <unk> , ACE WOODY , and his two <unk> BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY .
While Ace is dressed for work on a farm , both Brown and Jingle Bells Cody are <unk> who wear cool cowboy outfits .

Ace walks over to the slave in question .
Ace takes the <unk> out of the holster on his hip , and SHOOTS Sidney James point blank in the belly .
Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him .
Sidney James rolls in the dirt , screaming and holding his bleeding <unk> .

The remaining three mandingos jump a <unk> .
Now why did you do that ?
He won his last fight last night .
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos Those of you with exceptional ability will find it ain &apos;t so bad here .

That &apos;s Fritz , this is Tony .
You take good Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag , and hands it to the boy .
Once he &apos;s in the stable , give &apos; em that .
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one .
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms , when Oh , Monsieur Candie , about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about ?
I believe you said she spoke German ?
Oh Yes , Hildi , what about her ?
Do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room ?
Stephen , when you get through showing them to their rooms , go <unk> Hildi .
I want her cleaned up and <unk> &apos; nice , and sent over to Dr.Schultz &apos;s room .
Stephen has to be the <unk> of bad news .
Actually ... . Monsieur Candie ... . there &apos;s somethin &apos; we ain &apos;t tole you yet .
This gets Django &apos;s , Schultz &apos;s , and Candie &apos;s attention .
What &apos; <unk> think she doin &apos; in The Hot Box , Jesus Christ , how many people ran away Last night .
They brought her back this How bad did Stonesipher &apos;s dogs tear her up ?
Django &apos;s hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon .
If they <unk> those dogs on his <unk> , he &apos;s going to just kill all these Lucky for her they were busy lookin &apos; for D &apos;Artagnan &apos;s ass .
Brown and Cody went out lookin &apos; for her and found her .
She a little beat up , but she did that to herself .
Django &apos;s hand moves away from his gun .
How long she been in the box ?
What &apos;cha think , all goddamn day !
Little fool got ten more days to go .
Because I said so , that &apos;s why .
Hildi is my nigger .

Still , take Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and <unk> The overseers , &apos; <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> go to The <unk>
While Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water .
Django watches them walk to The Hot Box .
Dr.Schultz &apos;s eyes shift to Django , to watch him watch this .
Stephen notices Django &apos;s interest in both The Hot Box and whoever &apos;s itself is a large IRON <unk> <unk> <unk> DOOR ( from <unk> Prison ) built into the ground .
They put a key in the lock , and the two men lift the heavy iron door open .
REVEALING : A naked Broomhilda <unk> in a small coffin like iron box Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of <unk> <unk> .
Billy Crash <unk> the bucket of water on her .
DJANGO &apos;S POV : <unk> his wide shot perspective we see them yank the <unk> as we move into a <unk> <unk> CU of DJANGO &apos;S FACE .
You comin &apos; , or you wanna sleep in that Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House .
Stephen leads the two guests up the big <unk> <unk> staircase in the <unk> way of The Big House .
Then down the hallway with the guest rooms .
Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen .
Schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him .
Stephen takes Django to the room next door , opens the door , and leads him in .
A guest room with a big <unk> bed , <unk> drawer with a <unk> <unk> of water and basin on top of it .
A little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it .
This one &apos;s yours , boy .
That bed &apos;s damn Django walks over to the window , parts the curtains and peers out .
Broomhilda &apos;s gone .
As he looks through the glass , <unk> Stephen <unk> free to touch anything you want , cause we burnin &apos; all this shit once you gone .
I &apos;ll have somebody knock on the Django sits down on the bed .
I got more important things to do then Nigger , when I say stop you plant roots .
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead .
He turns around .
This tiny bell on this little table ... <unk> this for you ?
I ring this , you Django reaches over and picks up the bell .
I want you to pour some water in that Stephen does what he &apos;s told , but with <unk> .
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone .
Once Stephen &apos;s done , Django stands up from the bed .
Stephen hands him the basin full of water .
Then throws the water in Stephen &apos;s face .
The <unk> wet old slave can do nothing against this free man .
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face That &apos;s my kinda bell <unk> &apos; .
Git up .
The old man <unk> , slowly , and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again .
Then Django sits back down on the bed , looking at the old man on the I &apos;ve known me House Niggers like you my whole life .
Play your dog <unk> with your <unk> &apos; .
Ya &apos; lip off to him every now an &apos; then , as long as ya &apos; keep it funny .
He rolls his eyes and puts up with it , and all the white folks think it &apos;s so cute .

Oh that &apos;s right , he gives you first name <unk> ... . ain &apos;t that cute .
<unk> me me again nigger , see what happen &apos; .
Stephen lying on the floor , bites his tongue .
That &apos;s what I thought .
Now git outta &quot; here .
With as much dignity as he can <unk> , Stephen stands up .
Before he leaves , Django tells him ; , When I ring this bell , you better come a <unk> &apos; .
You - not nobody else .
While I &apos;m on this property , you my nigger Django lies down on the bed .
He covers his eyes with his arm .
A door joins Django and Schultz &apos;s room .
The adjoining door opens , and Django doesn &apos;t remove his arm <unk> eyes .
He ain &apos;t tellin &apos; nobody &apos; bout that .
That &apos;s all that needs to be said .
Lara Lee , Cora , and a <unk> , but cleaned up ( she &apos;s dressed in a <unk> <unk> uniform ) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz &apos;s door , after Calvin &apos;s sister raps on it .
Dr.Schultz , may I introduce to you , Hildi .
Hildi , this is Dr.Schultz , he I &apos;ve been informed you do as well .
It would be my , pleasure to speak with you Schultz acts for the <unk> of Miss Lara &apos;s <unk> .
She does , and just <unk> Lara Lee is to say something , Schultz says , &quot; Thank You very much , &quot; and closes the door in her face .
Miss Lara looks to her <unk> , and the two women head off <unk> .
With the door closed , Schultz turns to the weak , frightened , He gives her a pleasant smile .
They call you Hildi , but your real name Yes .
How do you know that ?
<unk> to reason who ever taught you German would also give you a German name .
Can I pour you a glass of water , <unk> her name being spoke <unk> for the first time in awhile , not to mention with a German accent , does have a bit of a calming influence on the other side of the adjoining door , listening , waiting for his cue As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water , he begins talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH ; I &apos;m aware you haven &apos;t spoken German in a long while .
So I &apos;ll talk slowly .
I &apos;m only speaking German to you now , Broomhilda , in case Candie &apos;s people are listening to us .
<unk> and a mutual friend of <unk> , have gone through a lot of trouble , and rode a lot of miles , to find you fraulein - to <unk> you .
He hands her a tall clear glass of water .
She looks at him weird , <unk> me ?
Now it &apos;s myself and our mutual friend &apos;s intention to take you away from here I can &apos;t tell you .
Our mutual friend has a <unk> for the dramatic , and he wants to He points at the adjoining door .
Her head moves in the direction of the door .
He looks to the young woman ; Dr.Schultz moves to the door , and lightly raps on it .
Her husband Django , but different , all <unk> out and cleaned up .
He smiles at her , and says ; Obviously a <unk> name between them .
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock ... <unk> she loses strength in her wrist , so the glass tips over , and the water <unk> on the floor ... <unk> quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead .
<unk> .
The two men look at the woman on the floor , then at each other ; WE DISSOLVE to later , as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain <unk> they &apos;re doing there , who they &apos;re pretending to be , and what their plan is to Broomhilda .
We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack .
It &apos;s not a happy tune .. <unk> se .
But it &apos;s pretty , and WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN The doomed men who didn &apos;t sell at Greenville , <unk> Rodney and Chester and Chicken Charly , spend their last night at Candyland sleeping under the stars in The Slave <unk> .
The same whistling tune Rodney sees , The whole slave selling and buying group , Django , Dr.Schultz , Candie , Bartholomew , Moguy , Ace Woody , Brown and Cody , and the <unk> , walk across the plantation grounds on their way to The <unk> .
<unk> &apos; and <unk> &apos; all the way .
The <unk> Rodney feels for that group of men <unk> inside him like a red hot poker .
in the dining room of The Big House with its <unk> , spoons and <unk> .
She &apos;s all by herself as she goes through this duty .
The whistling tune we &apos;ve been listening to has been coming from Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table .
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen .
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen &apos;s direction .
You weren &apos;t <unk> &apos; nothin &apos; , you were I dunno .
<unk> &apos; I heard .
I don &apos;t know She doesn &apos;t say anything in return .
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda .
I &apos;m just sayin &apos; , two days ago you <unk> &apos; in such misery here , you hadda run off .
So you run off , we catch your ass an &apos; drag you back .
Then we stick your bare ass to <unk> in The Hot Box for &apos; &apos; bout ten hours .
Now here you are two days later , <unk> &apos; while you work .
I &apos;m just sayin &apos; , <unk> &apos; think you &apos;d have a hellva lot to whistle &apos; bout .
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda &apos;s face .
I &apos;m done here , may I be <unk> ?
She moves off to another part of the house .
Later that evening , Django and a lot of other white people ( Calvin Candie , Lara Lee , Moguy , and Dr.Schultz ) sat around the dinner table .
They are being served by the black people we &apos;ve come to know at Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service .
Knowing Django &apos;s a slaver , and for his dinner table <unk> , the Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver , even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade .
We pick up the conversation in <unk> .
Look Monsieur Candle , they were all fine <unk> , no doubt about it .
But the best three , by far , were <unk> , Goldie , and Eskimo Joe .
- By the way , why &apos;s he Oh you never know how these nigger <unk> get started .
His name was <unk> ... maybe one day he said he was cold .. <unk> knows ?
<unk> , we all know Samson &apos;s your best , and you &apos;ll never sell him and I can Django contradicts , as he chews his steak ; Samson &apos;s the <unk> .
The other two All the <unk> Slaves around the table <unk> at <unk> Django Including Broomhilda , who &apos;s <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
After Django says that , while in shock , she over pours beef <unk> on Lara Lee &apos;s mashed Instead of getting angry , Candle seems to <unk> on that <unk> , Can Eskimo Joe whip <unk> , no .
Can he take Goldie , probably not - Goldie &apos;s the best dirty fightin &apos; nigger I ever saw .
But as long as you don &apos;t put &apos; em up against those two . , Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass .
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that .
You must understand , Monsieur Candie , while <unk> a <unk> in the nigger fight game , I do have a bit of a background in the <unk> <unk> circus .
<unk> , I have big <unk> when it comes to <unk> .
I need something more then just a big nigger .
He needs to have panache .
A sense of <unk> .
I want to be able to .
bill .
him as .
The Black <unk> .
I said . , and I <unk> ; &quot; I would pay top dollar for the , right nigger . &quot;
Now I &apos;m not saying Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ... but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin &apos;s response .
He <unk> the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep , then says ; Dr.Schultz , i will have you know , there is no one in the nigger fight game that more then , Monsieur Calvin <unk> Candie .
But one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game .
A nigger that can win fights .
That should be your first , second , third , four , and fifth concern .
After you have that , and you know you have that , then , you can start to <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
But since I enjoy <unk> man &apos; at the table status - beating Moguy by one year for that honor allow the old <unk> to <unk> , Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans .
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German .. She smiles , and says something pleasant back .
I see you two gettin &apos; on ?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin ; Monsieur Candie , you can &apos;t imagine what it &apos;s like not to hear you native tongue Hell , I can &apos;t imagine two weeks in <unk> .
I can &apos;t express the <unk> I felt <unk> in my mother tongue .
And Broomhilda is a As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy , Lara Lee notices how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other .
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie .
I don &apos;t know doctor , you can lay on all the German sweet talk you want , but it looks like this <unk> got big eyes for Lara Lee has no idea how right she is , but when she said it , all three , Django , Broomhilda , and Schultz , <unk> jerk .
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his <unk> <unk> gook .
Except for Stephen , no one else was the <unk> .
Broomhilda takes her <unk> and leaves the dining room for the Stephen watches her go , then looks at Django , then hands Candie his mint julep , and goes into a broad routine for the table &apos;s <unk> .
Stephen , you &apos;re amazing .
I haven &apos;t finished a drink in this house in twenty years .
When a man likes a cold drink , a man likes Did you <unk> that joke I said about me spending two weeks in <unk> You don &apos;t have any idea the work I do to see food gets on the table .
What does that hafta do with the price of You think when I &apos;m in that kitchen , I got nothin &apos; better to do then listen in here Of course they <unk> , their <unk> raised them right .
When they &apos;re a guest in somebody &apos;s house , and the master of of the house thinks he <unk> funny , you suppose to laugh .
They &apos;d be rude not to .
They play their little comedy routine for all it &apos;s worth .
Now what do you expect these people to say ?
What you need to do is stop Everybody don &apos;t laugh at him , you &apos;re being polite , I understand , you mean well , but As the white folks <unk> , Stephen moves back into the kitchen .
Once Stephen enters the kitchen , his smile melts away , and he locks eyes on Broomhilda .
He moves over to her .
Don &apos;t stall me bitch , you know who ?
At the table ?
I don &apos;t know him .
You wouldn &apos;t lie to me now , would you ?
Pick it up again in <unk> .
Eskimo Joe &apos;s a <unk> nigger , no doubt about it .
But if it was my money , I Well , if I , was inclined to be generous , .
and I don &apos;t know why I would be inclined to be generous ... . nine thousand ... . maybe .
But the real question is , not how much he cost , but how much he can <unk> ?
In a years time , seven or eight fights - outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland <unk> weren &apos;t well known - <unk> ... <unk> -- all goes well ... twenty to twenty <unk> Bright Boy , good on ya .
Any way you cut that <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
Not to , mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a <unk> nigger .
However let me <unk> how this whole <unk> came about .
It wasn &apos;t me who came to you to sell a nigger , it was you who approached me to buy one .
Now that nine thousand dollar figure Bright Boy was <unk> about , ain &apos;t too far off from right .
And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that , I could sell &apos; em any day of the week .
But like you said in Greenville doctor , I don &apos;t wanna sell &apos; em .
It was only your dollars that would make me consider it .
Dr.Schultz <unk> <unk> Candie &apos;s words , then suddenly says ; You know Monsieur Candie ... . you do possess Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand , and says ; Why not !
Monsieur Candie , you have a deal , The White people at the table get very happy .
However , that is a tremendous amount of money .
And the way you have your Mr.Moguy , I have a lawyer , a <unk> man named <unk> .
And I would need my man to draw up a legal <unk> before I would feel money for flesh .
Not to mention having Eskimo Joe <unk> by a physician of my choosing .
So say I return in about five days time with my <unk>
And then my <unk> and your Mr.Moguy can hash out Stephen , Cora , Broomhilda , and the other Domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes .
Can I take away your dishes , Monsieur Candle ?
She begins gathering the dirty dishes .
Candie looks up at her as she works .
So Hildi , how you like servin at the big I like it a lot Monsieur Candle .
It &apos;s a lot better then <unk> in that hot box , or <unk> &apos; your ass through a With Candie <unk> Broomhilda , Django <unk> up .
Stephen decides to test Django &apos;s reaction .
You know Monsieur Candle , the doctor might be interested in seein &apos; Hildi &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; back .
<unk> &apos; as he don &apos;t see many niggers When you was alone with Hildi here , <unk> just speak German , or did ya git her So you haven &apos;t seen her back ?
Then Stephen &apos;s right , you would probably find this interesting .
Hildi , take off your dress , and show us your back .
Broomhilda <unk> shoots a look to Django .
Calvin , I just got her all dressed up But Lara Lee , Dr.Schultz is from <unk> , they don &apos;t got niggers there .
And he &apos;s a man of <unk> .
I &apos;m sure it would <unk> him , the niggers <unk> for pain .
I mean Hildi got something like fifteen <unk> on her back .
Lara Lee get one , she &apos;d lose her mind .
These niggers are tough , no doubt about it .
Calvin , we are eating - <unk> , no less .
Ain &apos;t no one wanna see her whipped up back .
Django continues to watching this play out .
Okay okay Lara .
Maybe after dinner .
Broomhilda - <unk> - takes Calvin &apos;s dishes and heads back into the Stephen takes one more look at Django , and follows Broomhilda behind In the kitchen with the OTHER <unk> , Stephen says to Broomhilda ; I thought you said you didn &apos;t know him ?
Stephen approaches her , the other Domestics get quiet and watch .
I said , you said , you didn &apos;t know him ?
As tears begin to well in her eyes .
<unk> have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen , that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside .
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say ; Stephen hears this , he &apos;s starting to get the idea .
Stephen moves to the kitchen door , swings it open , and watches Dr.Schultz prepare to <unk> Candie for Broomhilda .
Stephen knows these two jokers are up to something , and now he &apos;s You <unk> earlier you would be Well in that case allow me to propose In full &quot; Ole Jimmie &quot; performance , Stephen <unk> in the room , Oh , I do apologize , doctor .
My <unk> &apos; ain &apos;t worth a damn these days .

If you could <unk> it .
It &apos;s about <unk> .
I would rather tell you in private .
We &apos;re having rhubarb pie , what sort of <unk> could be <unk> back there ?
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear ; Well that &apos;s a horse of a different color .
That means whatever Stephen has to say , hasn &apos;t anything to do with rhubarb pie .
&quot; <unk> me in the Fine friend Stephen , I &apos;ll be along <unk> .
Candie stands up from his chair and <unk> the table .
Well as you can see , talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen , from time to If you &apos;ll excuse me a moment .

There &apos;s comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe .
When WE CUT TO this room , we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs , drinking a brandy out of a brandy <unk> .
Calvin enters the room , sees Stephen sitting in the chair , drinking his brandy , and doesn &apos;t bat an eye .
It appears , in this room , Calvin &apos;s and Stephen &apos;s life long <unk> exits on a different plane .
Outside of outside eyes , in this room , all <unk> of master and slave is dropped , and the number one and number two .. men of Candyland can talk Those motherfuckers ain &apos;t here to buy no mandingos .

I was beginning to think you and that of <unk> ran off together .
Schultz and Django feel the change in their <unk> &apos;s demeanor , as he stares down the table at them .
That &apos;d be a hellva note , wouldn &apos;t it Lara Lee , I just looked out the big winda .
Ace Woody &apos;s out there <unk> &apos; with some <unk> slaver <unk> &apos; a <unk> of Ponys .
Would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball .

Holding the hammer in his hand , Candie continues to hold court .
Now where were we ?
Oh yes , I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door , holding <unk> in his grip , Broomhilda .
He holds a small Derringer pistol against the side of her head .
Now it should be quite clear by now I know you &apos;re not here to buy no mandingos .

But y &apos;all don &apos;t want me to know how much you want &apos; er .
So instead , you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe Stephen , put her in that chair .
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy &apos;s old chair .
With their palms against the table , <unk> , Django and Schultz Candie , still holding the hammer , continues .
Now the way I see it , ain &apos;t nothin &apos; changed .. You still wanna buy a nigger , I still wanna sell one .
So , with that in mind , in Greenville , Dr.Schultz , you yourself said , &quot; For the Right Nigger you &apos;d be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount . &quot;
To which , me myself said , &quot; What is your <unk> of ridiculous ? &quot;
To which you said , &quot; <unk> Now <unk> you two have ridden a whole lotta miles , went to a whole lotta trouble , and done spread a whole lotta bull , to purchase the lovely lady to my left , it would appear that Broomhilda is , &quot; The Right Nigger . &quot;
And if y &apos;all wanna leave Candyland with Broomhilda , the price is twelve thousand dollars .
I take it you <unk> the take it or leave Candie <unk> to hold the hammer continues .
Under the laws of Chickasaw County , Broomhilda is my property .
And I can do anything with my property I so <unk> .
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table , making And if you think my price for this nigger is too <unk> , what I &apos;m gonna <unk> to do is , take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it .
Right in front of both y &apos;all .
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda &apos;s sitting in .
Put up or shut up , Schultz .
You wanna save this nigger bitch , you gonna pay my price .
May I lift my hands from the table top in Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit He slides the billfold down the table to Candie .
The plantation owner takes out the money , does a quick count , then looks down the table at INSERT : Calvin signing over Broomhilda &apos;s BILL OF <unk> .
Broomhilda stands next to Django , and watches her Master sign her Dr.Schultz sits off by himself .
He &apos;s very <unk> .
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and <unk> Candie &apos;s <unk> with glasses of <unk> .
Lara Lee , Ace Woody , and Brown and Cody have <unk> the &apos; <unk> .
For an experienced <unk> , the just <unk> transaction is a thing of legend .
He just sold a Pony , with a <unk> up back , and a runaway &quot; r &quot; burned in her cheek - ain &apos;t worth five hundred Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else .
The Other <unk> bring out little <unk> of rhubarb pie , and <unk> around pouring coffee for the white people .
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz , he carries a small plate of Schultz looks at the pie and the man .
Are you <unk> &apos; bout me getting the best Actually , I was thinking of that poor devil you <unk> to the dogs today , D &apos;Artagnan .
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs .
Broomhilda &apos;s bill of sale , and her freedom papers .
As he says the following he Alexander Dumas .
He wrote &quot; The Three <unk> . &quot;
I figured you must be an <unk> .
You named your slave after that <unk> &apos;s lead character .
If Alexander Dumas had been there today , I wonder what he would of made of it ?
Yes his <unk> would be a <unk> <unk> Schultz rises , puts the papers in his back pocket , <unk> to his two companions , Django and Broomhilda , and says ; Normally Monsieur Candie , I would say , auf wiedersehen .
But since what auf wiedersehen actually means is , till I see you again , and since I never wish to see you again , to you sir , I say , goodbye .
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit .
When Calvin says to the German &apos;s back ; It &apos;s a <unk> here in the South , once a business deal is <unk> , for the two parties to shake hands .
It <unk> good You &apos;re in my house , doctor , I &apos;m afraid <unk> what ... ?
That I shake your hand before I leave ?
Then I &apos;m afraid I must Calvin walks closer to the German doctor .
You know what I think you are ?
What you think I am ?
No I don &apos;t .
I think you are a bad <unk> .
And I think you &apos;re an <unk> <unk> .
Never the less , here in Chickasaw County a deal ain &apos;t done till the two parties have shook hands .
Even after all this paper <unk> &apos; , don &apos;t mean shit you don &apos;t shake my hand .
If I don &apos;t shake your hand , you &apos;re gonna throw Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda .
Bartholomew , if she tries to leave here before this German shakes my hand .
Schultz looks to Django ... . then to Candle .. .and then with a smile on his face , and a <unk> in his eye , asks You really want me to shake your hand ?
The German crosses toward Candie , offering him his hand ... Candie offers his hand to Schultz ...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz &apos;s outstretched hand ...
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart .
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart , and he is BLOWN <unk> by Bartholomew &apos;s <unk> OFF SHOTGUN .
The room comes to its senses and <unk> Django and Broomhilda .
We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see : The <unk> of Django &apos;s bare feet .
A rope is tied around the ankles , and it &apos;s obvious he &apos;s been <unk> up , upside down .
The CAMERA moves down his naked body , down his legs ( we see his wrists are <unk> with ropes to his thigh ) , down his bare <unk> , down his whip scarred back , to the back of his head which <unk> just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor .
<unk> year old stable boy , Timmy , wipes the unconscious Django &apos;s face with a wet rag .
They are all alone in the barn .
Django begins to come to ... Hildi , the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago .
They had her in The I don &apos;t know &apos; bout no girl .
How &apos; bout that German white man I came Oh he &apos;s dead .
His body &apos;s over there .
Django twists upside down on the rope , and sees the corpse of his friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor .
The sight of the <unk> <unk> of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger .
Just then head <unk> Ace Woody walks in the barn .
Upon seeing Ace , Timmy <unk> it out of there , Ace throws an empty Django , slightly .. <unk> to and <unk> from the rope , looks upside down at Ace Woody , all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie , which makes him look a bit like <unk> <unk> .
Django thinks , &quot; How does he know ? &quot;
I knew there was something <unk> &apos; bout , y &apos;all .
We found your wanted <unk> and book of figures in your saddle bags .
I gotta say , ain &apos;t never heard of no black bounty hunter before .
A black boy paid to kill white men ?
How did ya like that Well , it turns out I was a natural .
Boy , people &apos; round here are cross wit you .
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny <unk> stool , and sits down on it , a body See Boss Man was a rather <unk> figure &apos; round here .
Now he &apos;s dead as fried chicken , Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket , we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his <unk> , he carries a HUGE <unk> KNIFE <unk> shoulder holster .
He removes the big blade from its sheath .

IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor , four inches from Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny <unk> stool , and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and Django , pulls the blade out of the floor , and walks back to his stool , and sits back down .
As he does this , he says ; Now I understand you didn &apos;t really have nuttin &apos; to do wit it .
It &apos;s that German <unk> the trouble maker .
You just wanted to git your girl , and <unk> your nigger asses outta here .
Now I appreciate that .
But <unk> folks &apos; round here need someone to blame .
And I guess they figure if you hadn &apos;t brought your black ass &apos; round here in the first place , Boss Man still be alive .
And you know what , they got a point .
<unk> time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django &apos;s face .
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool .
Now when it comes to making a nigger <unk> the error of his ways , believe me when I. tell you , I know every goddamn trick in the book .
Now there &apos;s a lotta ass <unk> out there try an &apos; git <unk> with the way they bust ass .

Ace Woody stands up , walks the floor to the Bowie , yanks it out of the wood . , and <unk> up , standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man .
Ace talks <unk> to the bound man at his You know <unk> , here at Candyland , I had me a real sweet deal .

He grabs a <unk> of Django &apos;s <unk> in his fist .
He takes his big Bowie , and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django &apos;s nut sack .
Django dances at the end of the rope like live <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .

Colonel takes a long drink from the glass , then puts it down Monsieur , to both your family , and your The French Farmer sit &apos;s at his wooden dinner table across from Col Landa leans forward , and says to the Farmer in a low tone of Monsieur LaPadite , what we have to discuss , &apos; would be better <unk> in private .
You &apos;ll notice , I left my men <unk> if it wouldn &apos;t <unk> them , could you ask your lovely ladies to step <unk> , would you take the girls outside .
The Colonel and I need to have The Farmers wife follows her <unk> orders , and <unk> her daughter &apos;s taking them outside , closing the door behind them .
The Two Men are alone , at the farmers dinner table , in the Farmers Monsieur LaPadite , I <unk> to inform you I &apos;ve exhausted the <unk> of my French .
To continue to speak it so <unk> me .
However , I &apos;ve been lead to believe you speak English quite well ?
Well , it just so happens , I do as well .
This being your house , I ask your permission to switch to English , for the familiar with you , and your family .
I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am .
Are you aware This is good .
Are you aware of the job I &apos;ve been <unk> to carry out in France ?
Please tell me what you &apos;ve heard ?
I &apos;ve heard , the <unk> has put you in charge of <unk> up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding , or passing The Fuhrer couldn &apos;t of said it better But the meaning of your visit , pleasant though it is , is <unk> to me .
The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews , and found I &apos;m aware of that , I read the report on this area .
But like any <unk> , always a slight <unk> of <unk> .
Most of it being a complete waste of time , but needs to be done nevertheless .
I just have A few questions Monsieur LaPadite , if you can assist me with answers , my department can close the Taking his black leather <unk> case , and placing it on the table , he takes out a <unk> from inside .
He also <unk> a expensive black <unk> pen from his uniform front pocket .
Opening the <unk> , and Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area , all The <unk> , The <unk> , The <unk> , and The Dreyfus &apos;s , is that correct ?
To my knowledge those were the Jewish - Heer Colonel , would it <unk> you if Please , Monsieur LaPadite , it is your The Farmer gets up from the table , goes to his <unk> over the <unk> , and removes from it a <unk> BOX that <unk> all the <unk> to his pipe .
He sits back down at the table with his Nazi As The Farmer <unk> the <unk> of his pipe with tobacco , sets a match to it , and begins slowly puffing , making it red hot , the S.S.
Colonel studies the papers in front of him .
Now according to these papers , all the Jewish families in this area have been <unk> for - except , The Dreyfusis .
Somewhere in the last year it would appear Which leads me to the <unk> that they &apos;ve ether made good their escape , or someone is very <unk> hiding What have you heard about The Dreyfusis - I love rumors !
<unk> can be so <unk> , where rumors , true or <unk> are often reveling .
So Monsieur LaPadite , what rumors have you heard <unk> <unk> <unk> Monsieur LaPadite , I want to hear what the rumors are , not who told The Farmer <unk> <unk> on his pipe .
Again , this is just a <unk> - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way So the rumors you &apos;ve heard have been of Were the <unk> and the Dreyfusis As the Farmer answers this question , the CAMERA <unk> behind his chair , to the floor , past the floor , to a small area underneath the lying vertically underneath the farmers <unk> .
These human beings are The <unk> , who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year .
But one couldn &apos;t call what The Dreyfusis have done for the last year living .
This family has done the only thing they could , hidden from a <unk> army that wishes to We were families in the same <unk> , in the same <unk> .
I wouldn &apos;t say we were friends , but members of the same The S.S.
Colonel takes in this answer , seems to except it , then moves Having never met the Dreyfusis , would you <unk> for me the exact members of And the children ... <unk> ... and <unk> .
<unk> - six - I believe .
And Shosanna , was fifteen or sixteen , I &apos;m not really The <unk> and her three <unk> finish taking the laundry off the They can &apos;t hear anything going on inside .
e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three <unk> .
Well I guess that should do it .
Be begins gathering up his papers , and putting them back into his the Farmer , cool as a cucumber , <unk> on his pipe .
However , before I go , could I have another Farmer stands up , goes over to the ice box , and takes out the <unk> of milk .
As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel &apos;s glass , Monsieur LaPadite , are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given I have no interest in such things .
But you are aware of what they call me ?
That they call you , &quot; The Jew Hunter &quot; .
apparently <unk> the <unk> the good people of <unk> <unk> on him .
Actually why he would hate the name , &quot; The <unk> &quot; , is <unk> to me It would appear he did everything in his power to <unk> it .
But I , on the other hand , love my <unk> title , As &quot; The Jew Hunter &quot; enjoys his fresh milk , he continues to <unk> The <unk> that makes me such a <unk> hunter of the Jews , is , as <unk> to most German soldiers , I can think like a jew .
where they can only think like a German , or more <unk> , a German soldier .
Now if one were to <unk> what <unk> the German people share with a beast , it would be the <unk> and <unk> instinct Negro &apos;s - gorilla &apos;s - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - <unk> size .
But , if one were to <unk> what <unk> the jews share with a beast , it would be Now the Fuhrer and <unk> propaganda have said pretty much the same thing .
Where our <unk> <unk> , is I don &apos;t Consider for a moment , the world a rat lives in .
It &apos;s a hostile world indeed .
If a rat were to <unk> through your front door right now , would you greet it <unk> a rat ever done anything to you to create this <unk> you feel toward <unk> &apos;s spread <unk> , they bite people - - Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one , rats don &apos;t make it a <unk> of biting human beings .
<unk> were the cause of the <unk> <unk> , but that was some time ago .
In all your born days , has a rat ever <unk> you to be sick a day in your life ?
I purpose to you , any <unk> a rat could spread , Yet I assume you don &apos;t share the same <unk> with <unk> that you do with Yet , they are both rodent &apos;s , are they not ?
And except for the fact that one has a big <unk> tail , while the other has a long <unk> tail of rodent skin , they even rather look alike , don &apos;t they ?
However , interesting as the thought may be , it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel .
If a rat were to <unk> through your door , this very minute , would you offer it a saucer of your I didn &apos;t think so .
You don &apos;t like them .
You don &apos;t really know why you don &apos;t like them .
All you know is , you find them What a <unk> hostile world a rat must endure .
Yet , not only does he survive , he thrives .
And the reason for this , is because our little <unk> has a second to none .
And that Monsieur , is what a jew <unk> with a rat .
a search of a house <unk> of hiding jews .
Where does the <unk> look ?
He looks in the barn , he looks in the attic , he looks in the <unk> - he looks everywhere , he would hide .
But there are many places it would never <unk> to a <unk> to hide .
However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my <unk> in <unk> , and placed me in French <unk> country today , is because it does <unk> to me .
Because I &apos;m aware what tremendous <unk> human beings are <unk> of once they <unk> May I smoke my pipe as well ?
<unk> e Farmer &apos;s cool <unk> is little by little <unk> .
Please , <unk> , make yourself at home .
The Jew Hunter , removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco <unk> .
The pipe , <unk> enough , is a <unk> , made from a &quot; S &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> a yellow skin , made famous by <unk> <unk> .
A the Nazi Colonel , busies himself with his smoking life , he <unk> to hold court at the <unk> table .
The other mistake the German soldier make is their <unk> <unk> of the citizens who give <unk> and aid to the Jews .
These citizens are not enemies of the state .
They are simply confused people , trying to make some sense out of These citizens do not need <unk> .
They simply need to be reminded of their Let &apos;s use you as a <unk> Monsieur LaPadite .
In this war , you have found yourself in the middle of a <unk> that has nothing to do with yourself , your lovely ladies , or your <unk> - yet , So Monsieur LaPadite , let me purpose a question .
In this time of war , what is your number one duty ?
Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath ?
Or , is it to <unk> the <unk> army to the best of your ability ?
Or , is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of <unk> who can Or , is your number one duty in this time of <unk> , to protect those very The Colonel lets the last statement stand .
That was a question Monsieur LaPadite .
In this time of war , What do you consider Now , my job <unk> , that I must have my men enter your home , and <unk> a <unk> search , before I can <unk> cross your families name off my list .
And if there are any <unk> to be found , rest <unk> , they will be .
That is unless , you have something to tell me that will make the <unk> of a I might add also , that any information that makes the <unk> of My duty easier , will not be met with punishment .
Actually quite the contrary , it will be And that reward will be , your family will cease to be <unk> in anyway , by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country .
The Farmer , pipe in mouth , stares across the table at his German You are <unk> enemies of the state , Point out to me the area &apos;s where their The Farmer points out the area &apos;s on the floor with the Dreyfusis are Since I haven &apos;t heard any <unk> , I assume that while their listening , I &apos;m going to switch back to french now , and I want you to follow my masquerade Colonel Landa stands up from the table , and switching to FRENCH says Monsieur LaPadite , I thank you for milk , and your <unk> .
I do believe our The Nazi Officer opens the front door , and silently motions for his Mademoiselle LaPadite , I thank you for your time , we shant be bothering your Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers , machine guns at ready , The Soldiers enter the doorway , Col Landa , silently points out area of the floor the Jews are hiding under .

The little farm house is filled with SMOKE , DUST , <unk> , SCREAMS , <unk> <unk> , and even alittle BLOOD .
With a hand motion from the Colonel , the Soldiers cut off their gunfire .
The Colonel keeps his finger in the air to <unk> silence .
The entire Dreyfus family lay dead .

She may not survive the night .
And after word spreads about what happened today , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> she will find any willing farmers to <unk> her aid .
If I had to guess her fate , I &apos;d say she &apos;ll probably be turned in by some <unk> .

True that .
The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet does rob the <unk> of a certain dignity , that is normally Aldo screams to The Basterd who &apos;s <unk> the two German <unk> is a little slow to respond .
So Hirschberg grabs him by the hair , YANKS him to his feet , and KICKS him in the ass , sending him on his way .
Most of The <unk> sit in a circle , Indian style , with As <unk> walks towards this circle of Basterds , A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR speaks over it should rule Europe .
But this is the first time he &apos;s ever been on the It &apos;s always been his <unk> , only a <unk> , in mind , body , and <unk> <unk> with the enemy under threat As Werner watched men cry like women , he made a <unk> to himself .
If his role is to die in this <unk> .
When they put him under the earth , his dignity would be buried with him .
For in the other world , the gods only respect the ones they test first .
Well Sgt , this is your test .
The captured German Sgt , enters the circle of Basterds , stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant , and Aldo returns the <unk> , looking up at him .

After all , for any true cinema lover , it &apos;s hard to hate Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema , late at night , lighting up a cigarette .
As she takes her first big drag , <unk> <unk> , the younger Shosanna , and the black projectionist Marcel , in the projection booth .
Shosanna lights up a cigarette , and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face HARD , knocking the cigarette out of her mouth .

Shosanna sits in the back of a French <unk> , reading a book , &quot; The <unk> in New York &quot; by <unk> <unk> , drinking wine .
When the young German Private from the other day , FREDRICK <unk> , walks in .
He gets a beer , then notices the French girl sitting in the back .

They make a <unk> over him in <unk> GERMAN , which <unk> Shosanna , or the <unk> German speaking members of the movies audience , can understand .
He signs <unk> for them , shakes their hands , and they I thought I was just a uniform ?

So if you had one big <unk> , that Of course , but that &apos;s not likely to TWO <unk> GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH <unk> approach the table .
They ask for Fredricks autograph , he signs it for them .
One of the French Girls says in FRENCH , how exciting it is to meet a real live German war hero .
Shosanna hears it .
They leave .
So that &apos;s it , she thinks .
So your a war hero ?

He takes a sip of beer .

They have <unk> for it in <unk> all over Paris .
That &apos;s another reason for all the attention .
&quot; Nation &apos;s Pride &quot; is about you ?
&quot; Nation &apos;s Not so <unk> .
So what are you doing having my picture taken with different that sort of thing .
Goebbels wants the film to premier in Paris , so I &apos;ve been Joseph is very <unk> on this film .
He &apos;s telling anybody who will listen , I &apos;ll be the German Van <unk> .
Shosanna , wasn &apos;t falling for the young German , by any <unk> .
However his exploits , as well as his <unk> manner , can &apos;t help but <unk> .
But his referring to Goebbels as &quot; Joseph &quot; , like their friends , is all she needed to get on the right side of things .
This young man is trouble with a <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; , and she needs to stay far fucking away from him .
Well , good luck with your premier Private .

The Driver begins to translate , when the Gestapo Major holds up his hand , telling him not to <unk> .
The Major looks at the young French girl and tells her in German ; Get your ass in that car .
No <unk> necessary .
She climbs into the back of the car , followed by the Germans .
The sedan takes off .
The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris the whole ride , never showing her Nazi <unk> sitting beside her .
We just hold on her face trying not to <unk> anything .
The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand .
She steps out of the car , and is lead into a Paris cafe by the Gestapo Officer .

He does hail from the bottom of <unk> Palu , he was in the film , and his brother is far more handsome Then .... so does the Gestapo Major .
He turns to the Sgt.
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do .
That table Major Hellstrom , the <unk> <unk> officer in the room , bows <unk> to the female German <unk> .
The Gestapo Major sits at the table , opposite Lt.Hicox , and Wicki .
The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein .

But seeing as we &apos;re all officers .
What say we play the game ?
Lt.Hicox begins to refuse , when Bridget ( feeling she knows The Major <unk> five cards from the other table , and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers .
So the <unk> of the game , is to write the name of a famous person on your card .
<unk> or <unk> , doesn &apos;t matter .
For instance , you could write <unk> or And they must be famous .
No Aunt <unk> &apos;s .
When you finish writing , put the card face down on the table , and move it to the person to your left .
The person to your right , will move their card in front of you .
You pick up the card without looking at it , lick the back , and stick it on your forehead like so .
And in ten yes or no questions , you must As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the <unk> points of the game , The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM , and BEGINS SLOWLY <unk> INTO STIGLITZ .

The Five players write their names ... Then move their cards to the right ... Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead ...

Now the two Germans are alone .
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk .
She lowers herself in the chair .
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk , opposite her .
The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over , and places it in front of the fraulein .

As Hans Landa stands , the sheer violence he had to call on to <unk> this task , still <unk> through him .
He tries to <unk> control of the trembling , that is <unk> through his body .
He takes out a silver SS <unk> , and knocks back a couple of <unk> .

He doesn &apos;t want you mad at him , he wants you to tell him what you know .
He uses you to get a line on Ordell , make a case , then take him federal .
I have a pretty good idea .
Ordell aint no <unk> and I doubt he &apos;s <unk> &apos; <unk> <unk> .
So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F.

I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble .
I &apos;m of today , but if I can &apos;t leave the country I &apos;m out of a job .
And if I don &apos;t got a job , I can &apos;t Ask A.T.F.
They might give you Well , Jackie , you got caught , you &apos;re gonna have to give &apos; em something .

Knowing they must be Nicolet and Dargus , he watches one of them take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside .

Max , doing what he &apos;s doing , looks up and sees Louis staring at him across the floor .
Max smiles and gives Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues to do what he was doing .
He quickly looks around the store to see anything else ; any more surprise guests , possible police surveillance .
Everything looks normal .
The saleswoman is behind the register <unk> up Jackie &apos;s purchase .
The few customers Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson &apos;s / May bag and head down a different aisle .
He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off .
Their whole fight is said tense and low .
I &apos;m getting out of here .

She tries to push past him , and he catches her by her arm <unk> it , <unk> .

Melanie , wearing her Melanie Louis , clutching the shopping bag close to his chest , walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars .
We STEDICAM alongside .
We walk for awhile , Louis changes direction to another aisle .
WE <unk> <unk> IN <unk> of him .
We see he has a searching look on his face .
You have no idea where you parked , do Jesus , but if you two aren &apos;t the biggest <unk> I &apos;ve ever seen in my life ... How did you ever rob a bank ?
When you robbed banks , did you have to look for your car then too ?
No Louis could kill her right now .
Just take his gun out of his pants and shoot her in her <unk> face .
But instead of doing what he wants , he does what he should .
He doesn &apos;t answer of look back .
( If he looked back and saw that <unk> , he couldn &apos;t e responsible for what happens .
) He changes directions , cuts down another aisle and <unk> for both their <unk> she shuts the fuck But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie .
They walk it ; it &apos;s not it .
Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the Is it this aisle or the next one In between two cars , Louis spins on her .
Don &apos;t say anything else , okay ?
I &apos;m telling you , keep your mouth shut .
Melanie was surprised by the <unk> , but is about to say something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says ; I mean it .
Don &apos;t say one fuckin &apos; Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him , shoots She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down .
BAM ... Louis shoots her again on the ground .
One ; to make sure .
Two ; cause it felt good .
Then he hurries of for his car .
WE FOLLOW IN <unk> OF HIM .
He looks around , then yells out ; See , just where I fuckin &apos; said it He hops in the car , and throws it into <unk> .
We can se Melanie &apos;s bare legs sticking out from a row of cars .
Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie , and yells through the passenger window ; Max Cherry &apos;s Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the Max , hands in pocket , strolls unhurriedly through the He walks around the store , keeping one eye <unk> toward the Designer Clothes <unk> .
He walks up to a jewelry counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display case , when a pretty , young <unk> comes up to him .
Not right now .
I &apos;m just killing time waiting for my wife .
But thanks , Sure thing .
If anything grabs you , He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit .
Oh , my God .
You look so cool .
Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out .
Max looks back to the jewelry display case , saying under Jackie looks at her <unk> in the mirror .
Then she lifts her eyes , meeting Max &apos;s across the room .
Max gives her a nod of his head to show he <unk> .
Jackie smiles and breaks contact , turning to Amy .
We hear her say from a distance .
&quot; This looks pretty good on me . &quot;
Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer He turns his attention back to <unk> through dresses He sees Louis and Melanie <unk> .
He sees Jackie <unk> into the fitting room .
He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance .
He watches Melanie , by herself , watch Amy leave .
Melanie watches the fitting room for a few <unk> .
<unk> her courage , then makes her move , entering the fitting room .
Max smiles to himself , &quot; so far so good &quot; he thinks .
He throws a look towards Louis , only to see Louis staring dead at him with an <unk> look on his face .
Max returns the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on his before he can see a reaction .
He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson &apos;s / May bag close to her chest .
He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room , go over to Amy and buy the dress .
Jackie goes into her act , acting <unk> and <unk> as she talks to Amy , pays with cash , then leaves stopping to say ; Oh , somebody left a shopping bag in Amy is left alone by the <unk> counter .
As Max looks at Amy , then at the fitting room entrance , Max , old boy .
You &apos;ve spent <unk> years dealing with people who take incredible <unk> .
You walk over to that counter , you &apos;re gonna find out ... then walks over to Amy .
Excuse me , but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the Yeah , I think they &apos;re back there .
Go get &apos; em .
There &apos;s nobody in there .
I think they &apos;re in the last stall .
Max walks toward the fitting room , enters it , walks down the length of <unk> , and stops in front of the last one .
He opens the door to the stall .
Sitting in the corner is the Robinson &apos;s / May bag .
He walks over to it , lifts out the towels , and sees all that money .
He <unk> the towels , picks up the bag and leaves .
<unk> walks across the Designer Clothes , passes by Amy , says ; Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the He &apos;s outside ; nobody &apos;s stopped him .
He keeps walking towards his blue Seville .
He keeps walking unhurriedly , never looking back .
He gets to his car , uses opening the car door as an excuse to look back at the mall .
It &apos;s normal .
Nobody &apos;s after him , nobody &apos;s watching him .
Max allows himself a smile , gets into his Cadillac with his half-a-million bucks and drives away .
Ordell sits at the bar in Sam &apos;s drinking a screwdriver The bartender hands him the phone .
A <unk> Louis drives the Toyota , calling Ordell on I got it .

He pulls out the towels and sees <unk> dollars on top of a bunch of <unk> .

Go meet Sheronda , give her the bag with fifty thousand , and go home .

A hand belonging to the <unk> Man &apos;s Voice ENTERS FRAME holding a white handkerchief with the name &quot; BILL &quot; <unk> in the corner , and begins <unk> <unk> away the blood from the young woman &apos;s face .
Little by little as the <unk> Voice speaks , the beautiful face underneath is <unk> to the But what can &apos;t be <unk> away , is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her , the In another age men who shook the world for their own <unk> were called <unk> .

This Japanese man in his <unk> greets the tall , blonde western girl with a <unk> <unk> .

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside .
She doesn &apos;t come across as one of the world &apos;s deadliest <unk> , but instead as a sweet , slightly <unk> , The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise , and Oh , &quot; <unk> &quot; , Very good -- very good , <unk> , just a few words I learned since yesterday .
- May I sit at the Sure sure sure - sit .
What other words did you learn - excuse me -- The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE , to someone OFFSCREEN .
The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it &apos;s almost hard to imagine there could be a back room to it .
Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling to a moment ago , The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride .
-- What other Japanese you learn ?
The Bride puts on a thinking face .
The Sushi Chef goes &quot; <unk> &quot; like he &apos;s just discovered the The Bride smiles and lets loose with a <unk> giggle .
Now you &apos;re making fun of me .

You say Well , thank you - I mean ... <unk> .
You should learn Japanese - very No <unk> , I heard it &apos;s kinda Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn &apos;t either hear your or understand you , he yells the word ; And everybody always speaks <unk> and <unk> immediately I always heard it was difficult .

A little <unk> JAPANESE MAN with a shitty <unk> , comes out from the back room .
He heads for the tall blonde asking in a <unk> voice in Japanese , &quot; What she wants to drink ? &quot;
Oh yes , a bottle of warm sake .
In Japanese he YELLS / <unk> the warm sake , the little <unk> Man disappears .
The Bride takes a bite out of her fish .

As the <unk> slices the next <unk> with a large knife , he I came to see a man .

There &apos;s a break in the Sushi Chef &apos;s <unk> .
After a beat , he brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth .
The little <unk> man appears with a bottle of warm sake , he pours one for The Bride , then disappears again .
As The Bride sips the sake , she looks at the <unk> .
As The Sushi Chef <unk> his finger , he looks at The Bride .
The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that point ... and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks ; What do you want with Hattori Why do you need Japanese steel ?
You must have big rats you need The trap door in the floor opens up , and <unk> HANZO ( Sushi Chef ) , climbs inside the room , followed by The Bride .
The room has many <unk> samurai swords in hand-carved wooden <unk> resting on wooden racks running the length of the second half of the attic .
The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel , looking and touching the shiny wood .
She looks behind her to Hanzo who is still by the trap door , and says ; The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH ; ... try the second one down in the She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny , black sheath .
Her hand lifts it from the rack .
She <unk> the steel , <unk> .... then with GREAT He pulls a baseball out of his pocket .

The blonde girl nods her head yes .
The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor , ... it will take me a week to make ..... before his head disappears , he says ; ... he closes the door behind him .
She smiles slightly ... then moves over to the window , takes out a handkerchief , and wipes Bill &apos;s name off .
Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo &apos;s voice in Japanese and I &apos;m done doing what I <unk> an <unk> to God years ago to never do that kills people . &quot;
And in that <unk> EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny , black wood sheath .

If on your Revenge is never a straight line .
It &apos;s a forest .
And like a forest it &apos;s easy to lose your way ... to get to forget where you came in .
To serve as a <unk> , a combat philosophy must be adopted that can be found in the secret <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And now my yellow We go back and forth between CU of HANZO <unk> the <unk> like a samurai <unk> <unk> and the Bride <unk> of <unk> enemy can be ... This is the first and <unk> ... Kill whoever stands in <unk> way , even if that be Lord God , or <unk> This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat .
Once it is one ...
Though the devil himself may The Bride repeats this ...
Her eyes look at the greatest maker of swords on this earth and says ; her white hand with her long fingers <unk> INTO FRAME and removes the beautiful , <unk> <unk> of vengeance .
A hand comes in and , as the Bride talks over this image , draws with a piece of <unk> , a portrait of the <unk> When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge , at the time it seems proof like no other , that not only does God <unk> , you &apos;re doing his will .
At a time when I knew the last about my enemies , the first name on my death list , was the <unk> to find .
But of course , when one <unk> the difficult task of becoming queen of keep it a secret , does one ?
The <unk> drawing gets color and <unk> <unk> , turning We see <unk> images of The Bride &apos;s <unk> .
At the age of twenty , Bill backed <unk> , over who would rule <unk> in <unk> images of O-Ren and her Army , taking on ANOTHER <unk> <unk> , among falling cherry <unk> .

And while you drink like fish and laugh like <unk> , they <unk> in the <unk> over the Of what <unk> do you speak , Boss Tanaka looks at the female <unk> American and says ; which I love more than my own <unk> than you can say <unk> <unk> , ... Boss Tanaka &apos;s head is <unk> from its body ... And from the spot between its shoulder blades , a <unk> of blood shoots up in the air .
The <unk> who were shocked at Tanaka &apos;s words are even more The two bodyguard &apos;s , standing behind Boss Tanaka , hands go to O-Ren turns her blade in their direction .
The <unk> and their bodyguards say nothing , ... only watch .
The lady looks across at the two men and says in and Fight me or work for me .
They look at her for a moment , then they lower their swords .
Put your <unk> on the floor .
The mistress &apos; eyes got to the other <unk> looking at her .
As she speaks English , bodyguard <unk> translate for I &apos;m going to say this in English so you know how serious I am .

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks .
The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American <unk> as a <unk> is , I Just like this fucker here .
Now if anything else to say , now &apos;s the The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant .
The <unk> all look up now as the crew passes .
The restaurant staff acts as if the <unk> himself has just showed up on their <unk> <unk> a meal .
No doubt if the meal is not <unk> the staff will <unk> slice off a finger .
The door to a private dining room is slid open , the crew steps inside , the door is slid shut .

And finally , the American in the black suit but sans Kato mask , O-Ren &apos;s SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something .
Like a <unk> in the forest , her head springs up on alert .
It &apos;s almost as if she &apos;s The Bride &apos;s <unk> SUDDENLY STOPS IN <unk> -- O-Ren removes a SMALL <unk> from the folds of her robe and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound .

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room , SLAMMING at the bar , in her kimono , drinking a colorful cocktail .
She observes all the activity by O-Ren &apos;s private dining room .
When the Yubari sisters go back inside , the Bride climbs off her <unk> and goes through the restaurant ... into the parking area ... and up to her <unk> car .
She opens the door .
Takes off her Japanese kimono , underneath is a <unk> yellow track suit with a black <unk> going down both sides , like the one <unk> Lee wears in &quot; <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
She tosses the kimono in the trunk , then removes the sheathed Hanzo sword .
With the sword of vengeance in her hand , we follow her back inside the restaurant .
She looks upstairs to the O-Ren dining room .
We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale , slide open the door , and walk down the stairs together .
When they get to the bottom , they give each other a kiss goodbye , and Yuki leaves the restaurant , while Sofie makes her way to the bathroom ... only to have The Bride , now dressed in her <unk> Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand , bar her way .
between CU &apos;s of the two women , face to face .

Before anybody on O-Ren &apos;s side of the room can say anything ... The Bride steps out from behind Sofie .

They start to approach ... The Bride , still holding the sword that &apos;s still <unk> the skilled Attacker , backs up , keeping his body between her and the remaining Like a boxer , The Bride uses the momentary break in the action , to rest on her feet .....

... Still Spinning like a break <unk> , she spins up on top of her head , and <unk> back up on her feet .
The seven remaining sword-weilding , black-suited boys moved out of range of the Bride &apos;s blade when she dropped to the floor .
Now spread out , they make a large <unk> .
The Bride , slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor , lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head .
In pointed up , watch them move closer , COLOR <unk> BACK INTO THE FILM .
We see her face is <unk> with blood .
GO GO stands by the restaurant &apos;s <unk> box , she flips the The Crazy make a wide circle around the blonde who &apos;s still ... Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows .

The snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow <unk> stage .
The eight <unk> are Black <unk> against the blue <unk> .
They begin to combat in a dance of blood , steel and death .
The Bride does a sword-weilding <unk> with all She <unk> with all of them - They <unk> - <unk> each other for a moment to the beat - then <unk> again , with The Bride killing or <unk> the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each <unk> - <unk> during the <unk> , The Bride <unk> down low in <unk> while the others continue to We Cut in closer whenever we need to .
Finally the last of O-Ren &apos;s soldiers falls to the Bride &apos;s Standing by the <unk> box , flips a switch turning the lights back on .
The <unk> shines light on ... <unk> all over with blood .
Blood <unk> the floor , walls and ceiling .
Dead bodies , <unk> limbs , and horribly wounded men who have yet to die , litter the ground .
With a big &quot; <unk> &quot; in the air , the blood of O-Ren &apos;s <unk> fly off the blonde <unk> &apos;s blade .
Then saying to the <unk> who litter the ground .
Those of you lucky enough to still have your lives .
Take them with you .
But leave the limbs you &apos;ve lost .

The wounded men , crawl out of the restaurant .
The <unk> <unk> woman , looks to the last remaining combatants ... Mr. Barrel , Go Go Yubari , and O-Ren steps forward and removes her weapon , it &apos;s not a samurai sword .

The Bride rolls out of the way , the metal ball PUNCHES a hole in an <unk> table instead .
The <unk> Bride <unk> a table leg loose from its She hops up on a table , table leg in hand , ready to fight .
Go Go hops up on a table ... As they fight they hop from table to table ... Go Go throws her ball and chain ...

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain ... it wraps around ... The Bride &apos;s leg is <unk> out from under her , she FALL Go Go jumps on top of the Bride , <unk> her with a samurai short sword .
The Bride uses the table leg to block it .
The women fight <unk> , locked in <unk> , each face ugly with struggle .
Go Go lets her left <unk> get too close to the Bride &apos;s mouth ... the Bride <unk> DOWN on it .
Go Go screams as the lower part of the <unk> is <unk> off , and she rolls off the Bride .
The Bride comes at her , bringing the table leg -- <unk> <unk> HER HEAD -- <unk> The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back , and delivers a powerful &quot; <unk> &quot;

The Bride rises from the floor and begins , twirling Go Go &apos;s Go Go , fast as she can , climbs up the stairs to the second The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs , twirling the ball and chain over her head .
Go Go frantically , and in great pain , climbs the stairs ...
The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain ...
It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari sisters , smack <unk> in the back of the head .
We see her face as she &apos;s delivered a death blow right behind it .
We see behind her eyes and features , her life and <unk> Like a discarded rag doll , Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the staircase landing in a pile at the Bride &apos;s feet .
Dead before The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor .
Her eyes go to the last two remaining combatants ... Any more <unk> for me to Tell me Mr. Barrel , why don &apos;t you wear your Kato mask ?
Are you and Mr. Barrel takes out a <unk> mask on a stick , like from a th <unk> <unk> ball , and holds it over his eyes .

And you &apos;re going to risk your life - to say nothing of <unk> me - for a woman who <unk> to you as a is furious , and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder .
The Bride acts like she &apos;s <unk> to witness what she Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren &apos;s direction shooting her a look she &apos;s never seen from him before .
He then looks back to the Bride .
Her eyes are waiting for his .
She says with just the slightest hint of <unk> in her voice ; He looks at her a BEAT longer ... then says as he <unk> his The things I do for a pretty face .
INSERT : The Blade sliding back down into the <unk> , The <unk> locks into place with a <unk> .
He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress , and O-Ren fries and <unk> on her head .
Then with his sheathed Sword in his right hand , and his left hand in his pants pocket , he walks across the <unk> room and out the front door .
As he walks , when he &apos;s parallel with the Bride , He stops and says ; About that one you owe me .
I &apos;ll be <unk> if you don &apos;t .

Swords however never get tired .

In the <unk> of this silence , his beeper goes off .
His eyes go to it .
It reads ; ELLE DRIVER .
He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F. , casually tosses the green on the felt and says ; Play a game of luck long enough you &apos;re bound to meet some lucky You know we &apos;ve never been <unk> No , you &apos;re rude .

Without another word he exits the hotel room .
Nobody makes a move to stop him .
L.F. O &apos;Boyle and her <unk> stand still as they wait for the sound of the elevator in the hall .
The Bride &apos;s Voice comes on the soundtrack ; What L.F. O &apos;Boyle didn &apos;t know was , the real game was just beginning .
Bill was on the job , and she was the <unk> .
Now Bill was the <unk> .
In fact the <unk> <unk> was <unk> for him .
And he rarely awhile - to keep his hand in - he does .
Only he plays a game .

It &apos;s kind of fun They hear the elevator in the hall .

The Five men go out the door .
The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway , only to see .... BILL , with his Hanzo sword <unk> , standing at the This wasn &apos;t expected , they <unk> their swords .
In the hotel &apos;s hallway , Bill cuts through the five men .
His <unk> of the Hanzo sword in his hand is <unk> .
He cuts through the first four rather quickly .
The fifth one , Alburt , is the most skilled , but he too falls under the master &apos;s L.F. O &apos;Boyle <unk> in her room , holding a gun , pointed at the She sits in <unk> <unk> , waiting for Bill , or anybody for that matter , to step through the doorway .
The window her back is up against <unk> , and a black gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair , and Bill on the <unk> of the hotel window , He &apos;s <unk> her outside and he &apos;s <unk> her over the side L.F. Is too <unk> to answer .
Bill watches her all the way down .
When he &apos;s confident her fall was <unk> , he leaves the <unk> .
A small camper trailer sits all by its <unk> in the middle A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image ; A fist knocks on the trailer door .
It opens , revealing Bill &apos;s brother , <unk> .
Not the <unk> <unk> Budd with the black suit and the <unk> black cowboy boots we saw earlier at the wedding chapel massacre .
No , the Budd we see now is the Budd who <unk> into a bottle five years ago , got himself comfortable , and decided to live Bill , looking like a cool million , stands out in the dirt and dust of Budd &apos;s lot of land , looking up at his brother in his natural <unk> .
In the B.G.
we can see Elle Driver <unk> Budd , surprised by the visitor , says ; Great day in the morning .
Brother Bill <unk> up to his <unk> Oh , you know my life , Bill , just a mad rush of wild parties and Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill &apos;s ear .
Is that that tall blonde <unk> <unk> bitch in the passenger seat ?
It &apos;s Elle .
Want to say hello ?
Never said &quot; bye , &quot; can &apos;t seem to think of a reason to say , &quot; hi . &quot;
Elle inside , <unk> both the stereo and the air <unk> .
She watches the <unk> scene play out through the car windshield .
Obviously there &apos;s no love lost between Are you not going to invite me in ?
It <unk> in there , that &apos;s why .
Now what &apos;s so important it requires a The <unk> brothers continue their conversation .
Budd sits in the doorway of his trailer , bottle of jack in his hand .
You tryin to tell me she cut her eight of them , they just called I dunno , I guess they thought it <unk> cool .
<unk> , she had about <unk> .
They all fell under her The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd &apos;s attention .
She got &apos; er a Hattori Hanzo sword ?
She has a Hanzo <unk> sword .
He made her one ?
Didn &apos;t he swear a blood <unk> never to make another It would appear he &apos;s broken it .
Budd doesn &apos;t say anything at first ... THEN ; Them Japs know how to carry a <unk> don &apos;t they ?
Or is it just you tend to bring that out in I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask , but you by any chance haven &apos;t kept up with Hell , I <unk> that years ago .
You <unk> a Hattori Hanzo sword ?
Not in El Paso it ain &apos;t .
In El <unk> I got me <unk> for it .
Since it was a gift from me , why didn &apos;t you offer me the chance to <unk> bum though I may be , I don &apos;t need <unk> that bad .
But who the hell gives a crap anyway .
That points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword .
I &apos;m a <unk> in a titty bar , Bill .
If she wants to fight me , all she gotta do is come down to the Club , start some shit , and we &apos;ll be in a a fight .
-- Budd , you need to listen to me .
I know we haven &apos;t spoken for quite some time , and the last time we spoke wasn &apos;t the most pleasant .
But you need to get over being mad at me , and start becoming afraid of Bea .
Because she is coming , and she &apos;s coming to kill you .
And unless you accept my assistance , I have no doubt she will succeed .
Budd sees Bill &apos;s true concern for his <unk> .
Bill tries to charm his brother .
Can &apos;t we forget the past , and look at the happy side of all this ?
And what would that happy side be ?
Budd is touched by Bill &apos;s concern and chuckles to himself .
I appreciate the concern on your <unk> .
I don &apos;t <unk> guilt .
And I her revenge .
And we deserve to die .
But then again , so does she .
So I guess we &apos;ll just see now , won &apos;t we .
The <unk> Club , is the <unk> titty bar that Budd works at .
His job is <unk> out the <unk> that &apos;s worse than him , out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had when they came in .
His <unk> pickup truck pulls up to the front , and he climbs out of the automobile .
Budd walks into the <unk> titty bar .
No <unk> goin on yet , just a few <unk> drinkin .
The owner , <unk> , yells at You &apos;re late , Budd , this shit ain &apos;t Budd doesn &apos;t say anything , he just moves towards the back , passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks .
ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies &apos; room and says to Hey , Budd , honey , the toilet &apos;s at it again .
There &apos;s shitty water all I &apos;ll take care of it , <unk> <unk> .
A brand new , enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking sits behind the wheel , looking at the bar and the bar &apos;s front door .
Using the rearview as a mirror , she grabs her long blonde hair and pulls it back to a <unk> with a <unk> .
Then places a baseball cap on the top of her <unk> that reads , &quot; <unk> &apos;S <unk> <unk> . &quot;
She steps out of the truck &apos;s cab .
She &apos;s dressed like a little Texas <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s , cowboy boots , and a &quot; <unk> <unk> : LOUD AND <unk> &quot; The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage explodes into <unk> <unk> <unk> .
She walks up to the bar and The <unk> gives her a beer bottle of <unk> <unk> .
As she ... Looking for Budd among the crowd ... ... he &apos;s sitting on a stool , observing the crowd , moving his SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes ; VENGEANCE THEME plays on Her hand removes her <unk> from its sheath .
She moves through the crowd of Texas <unk> , <unk> in hand , towards Budd Suddenly a BIG <unk> stands up from his table -- spilling every bottle and glass on it -- and <unk> all over .
Budd <unk> to himself , and heads over to the disaster area .
The Bride ... observes <unk> ... <unk> UP THE <unk> .
As the music from above continues , we see Budd driving his pickup on an empty highway home from work .
He passes by The Bride &apos;s new red pussy wagon parked on the side of the road .
After he <unk> by , she starts up the motor , but doesn &apos;t turn the lights on .
She follows him , hanging way back in the dark .
Budd driving , not seeing the automobile <unk> in darkness , Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper home .
He walks inside , shutting the door behind him .
The Bride rolls to a stop ... <unk> the lonely trailer out Texas <unk> music begins coming out of the camper .... We see his figure pass the camper window , once or twice .
The Bride <unk> her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo &apos;s samurai She doesn &apos;t say anything , <unk> will an actress of <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> her <unk> , but the <unk> member of the audience will read the <unk> of her choice .
His <unk> status be damned , the Budd who <unk> The Bride satisfaction was a warrior .
And it &apos;s that Budd she <unk> to send to his maker .
She takes a black stocking cap , and slips it on top of her skull , <unk> her blonde hair underneath ... ... <unk> black <unk> under both eyes , on top of both eyelids , and down the <unk> of her nose ... <unk> the cab lights above her , opens the truck door , and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air .
On her belly , Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand , she crawls across the desert floor towards Budd &apos;s trailer .
Somewhere in the <unk> <unk> a cat jumps on a rat .
Their The Bride stops and <unk> her face in the dirt .
From inside the trailer , we hear the needle being lifted off From a distance we see : The <unk> figure of Budd looking out the window of the camper .
The Bride keeps her face in the dirt .
The figure of Budd at the window , seems to dismiss the sound he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the The needle is placed back on the <unk> .

She hears the sound of a <unk> top <unk> ... The sound of pouring in a glass ... The sound of a glass being laid heavy on <unk> low on the balls of her feet , she , with great care , slowly and silently <unk> her Hanzo sword .
Through the bottom <unk> in the door , she sees the <unk> image of Budd &apos;s feet on the floor .
She slowly rises ... removes her black stocking cap ... blonde hair falls around her shoulders ... sword in right hand ... left QUICK as a Texas <unk> on glass -- She brings the sword &apos;s handle down hard on the door lock -- She <unk> the front door open ...

Both barrels BLAST in our face .

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the <unk> , cutting off the music .
Then with shotgun in hand , stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at The Bride .
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword <unk> from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- <unk> from Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt , standing over Bet your sweet ass that don &apos;t sting More <unk> coming out of The blood <unk> Bride .

She begins the journey before her by <unk> the steps The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred years ago , except now it &apos;s empty and dusty .
The Bride enters , She &apos;s <unk> from climbing up those fuckin Her Voice <unk> in the <unk> temple .
A beautiful <unk> staircase leads to Pai Mei &apos;s The still unseen Man &apos;s voice <unk> back ; If it is Christ you <unk> , turn back PAI MEI &apos;S POV : We see through <unk> Mei &apos;s <unk> , through a sheer <unk> scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area .
The Bride enters the room .
She approaches the old man , reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim , lowers to one knee and bows her * From here on end , whenever ENGLISH is spoken by The Bride , or every once in awhile by Pai Mei , it will be spoken in ENGLISH IN <unk> <unk> SOUND .
However , whenever <unk> is <unk> spoken , it comes out of their mouths as <unk> ENGLISH like in a &apos; s Shaw Brothers <unk> <unk> <unk> .

Long White <unk> , Long White <unk> , Long White <unk> , same long flowing White <unk> .
Everything &apos;s the same , except he &apos;s older , by about a hundred years .

And I am exquisite art of the Samurai Sword .

I would of thought an American would be <unk> to their The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer .
She opens the drawer ; it &apos;s filled with just about every type of edged The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword .
Pai Mei rises from his sitting position , for the first time , parts the scrim , and approaches the Bride .
Let &apos;s see how good you really are .
Try and land a blow .
If you land a single blow , I &apos;ll bow down and call The Bride doesn &apos;t need a second <unk> , she ATTACKS with He <unk> moves out of the way .
The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film , with Pai Mei <unk> at will all of her rapid sword <unk> .

While Pai Mei <unk> moves out He &apos;s <unk> , and <unk> while they fight ; Come now woman , can &apos;t you even hit Your ability really is quite poor .
He <unk> her with a blow to her chest , delivered with an open palm , that sends her flying back hard against the wall .
She <unk> her chest , and coughs up some blood .
Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white <unk> .

Pai Mei stands waiting for her , <unk> THE <unk> in his hand like a <unk> twirling a <unk> , till the twirling STOPS .
The sword &apos;s handle is pointed towards the Bride .
Give up ?
Or care to try again ?

Not to win , not even to land a blow , that she knows is impossible .
This man &apos;s ability is truly amazing .
However be that as it may , she &apos;s determined not to quit , and through not quitting , she &apos;s determined to <unk> herself in his eyes ... in some way .
She takes the sword from him and tries again .
But this time , Pai Mei keeps <unk> her arm that holds the sword , <unk> it into positions that would do the young girl harm ... Like bringing the blade up against her other That blade &apos;s sharp .
<unk> not to ... Then he TWISTS her arm , till the blade &apos;s against her own ... Then TWISTS again till it &apos;s against her hip ... ... Then TWISTS again while <unk> her leg , till the blade &apos;s If you can &apos;t fight any better than that , what use do you have for a He lets go of her arms , she swings furiously at him ... ... he calmly <unk> out of the way .
Then , he KICKS her in the stomach , <unk> her over , then he brings the Sword between her legs , Blade <unk> against her <unk> .
Now that really would be a <unk> .
He takes the sword from her grasp ...
The BLADE &apos;s against the pocket of her throat .
The BLADE &apos;s against the nipple of her right breast .
He tosses the sword in the air , catching it by the tip of the blade .
Then like a <unk> , brings the handle end down hard on the top of The Bride &apos;s head .
She lets out a <unk> , and falls to the floor , holding the <unk> on her <unk> .
I &apos;m a hundred and fifty years old , and you can &apos;t even make me break a He <unk> the sword in half with his hand .
Let &apos;s see your Tiger and Crane Like a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> film , they do their animal As she <unk> and he <unk> ... he yells out ; With little effort on his part , he reaches out and GRABS her wrist , TWISTS ... She &apos;s on the floor , with her arm stuck out in the air behind her , her wrist still between his fingers .
He could literally break her arm in half .
I asked you to show me what you know , and you did .
Not a goddamn Like all <unk> women , the only thing you know how to do is order in restaurants and spend a man &apos;s <unk> isn &apos;t it ?
I asked you I could <unk> off your arm at will .
He raises his other hand to <unk> off her arm .
If you wish to speak romantic <unk> , you &apos;ve come to the wrong Please don &apos;t cut my arm off !
It &apos;s my arm now .
I can do with it what I please .
If you can stop me , Have you ever felt this before ?
Compared to me you &apos;re as helpless as a <unk> fighting an <unk> , aren &apos;t He lets go of her wrist .

Is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you I &apos;ll be the judge of that .

That arm is still mine .
You may lose it yet .
Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him .
His right fist is <unk> back by his <unk> , he &apos;s <unk> on a certain spot on the wall .
The Bride stands behind him , watching .
He lets out a SCREAM , and puts his fist THROUGH THE <unk> .
He turns to the new student ; Since your arm now belongs to me , I want it strong .
Can you do that ?
I can , but not that close .
I can put my hand through that at And you could shoot a man from a if you so desired , but this is not what I asked .
What if your enemy is three inches in front of you , what do you do then ?

Or do you put your fist through He HITS the wall again leaving another hole .
The Bride takes her place in front of the wall .
She HITS it .
Only managing to <unk> the wall with the blood from her <unk> <unk> .
Then again .
And again ....
Both Pai Mei and The Bride sit at the dinner table .
Pai Mei <unk> on eating .
The Bride &apos;s hand is <unk> bloody .
She tries to eat a bowl of rice with <unk> , but her fingers won &apos;t work .
She puts down the sticks and takes a scoop of rice with her fingers .
Pai Mei <unk> her on top of her head with his stick .
If you want to eat like a dog , I will make you live and sleep like a dog .
Outside .
If you want to live and sleep like a human being , pick She looks at her fucked-up hand , then to the wall , It &apos;s the wood that should fear your hand , not the other way around .
No wonder you can &apos;t do it , you <unk> to defeat before you even He walks off in a huff .
Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large , round deep pit , dug in the earth .
In that pit , is a rat .
We see one lone rat in the huge pit .
In the sky , is a bird .
Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into <unk> , and SHOOTS A <unk> FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through You are to go into that pit , and catch that rat , with your bare hands .
If you catch the rat , I will <unk> you the victor , and tonight you will <unk> on bird .
But , if you can &apos;t catch the rat by <unk> , I &apos;ll <unk> the victor the rat .
And because of the <unk> to my student , I will be forced to kill it .

Because to be my student , you must develop a taste She hops into the pit , gets down on the ground , lock eyes with her rodent opponent , and goes after it .
<unk> her Tiger / Crane <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep .
Trying to catch the rat to no <unk> .
A golden arrow kills the rat .
She looks up and sees Pai Mei , golden bow in his hand , looking down on her .
It &apos;s <unk> .
She picks her dead <unk> up from the earth , and removes the golden arrow .
Then with the rat in her hand , she looks up to I acknowledge defeat at the <unk> of this rat .
However , I will not eat this filthy <unk> .
What I will But tomorrow , you kill a big bird .
She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth , and begins to chew .
Pai Mei looking down on her , says ; We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei , he gives an Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub , when he Woman , is that you who <unk> my She answers from outside the door ; She does , <unk> to one knee .
What news do you find so <unk> , as I did it <unk> .
I put my fist looking at the hole in the wall .
Very good .
Would you care to She moves in front of the wall ..... Takes her position ... Her right hand in a fist -- <unk> and loaded into position .... With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where she &apos;ll strike .... Like she &apos;s <unk> her energy into the She hits it HARD , but her fist doesn &apos;t go through .
Her eyes sneak a look at the old man , who wears no I think you watching is making me Not only that , it has you speaking before you were spoken to .
Try And when she does , she <unk> it .
She immediately goes down to her knees ; He just as immediately , lifts her back up .
You still fight better than you He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her .
Then the old man leaves to finish his bath .
The blonde gal begins again .... <unk> against wood ... no <unk> BLACK -- The <unk> <unk> turns on .
CU The BRIDE in <unk> .
Her breathing is normal .
We can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box .
Her <unk> is back .
Taking the flashlight , she <unk> the beam on the lid above her .... Along the line of the coffin &apos;s <unk> and the lid where many nails meet .... Then down to her Red Cowboy <unk> , bound by a leather belt around her .
<unk> her knees , as much as the coffin will allow , and <unk> her feet , she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belt &apos;s <unk> ... Then , using her bare feet , then her <unk> hands , to pass one of the boots up to her ... When the red boot is in her grasp , she turns it upside Opening the razor , she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists , till both hands are free .
She positions the flashlight so its <unk> <unk> on the coffin lid .
The lid &apos;s about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose , about three inches from her hand .
AS COMBAT <unk> <unk> TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK , she begins to <unk> .
Her eyes <unk> on the wood above her , her left hand reaches out , touches the pine , passing her energy ... Her long , white fingers , ball up into a FIST .... ... and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her .
With each <unk> she lets out a <unk> SCREAM ...
Her FIST SMASHES into the wood , leaving BLOOD on the lid ...
<unk> begins to <unk> through the cracks onto the Bride ...
THE <unk> SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water ...
Through six feet of dirt , we watch , the Bride - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> - <unk> the earth like a <unk> plant and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> for surface air .
A SHOT straight out of an Italian <unk> film .
We see the <unk> of &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and the <unk> of dirt over her The Bride &apos;s hand breaks the surface ... then like one of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> herself from mother Once <unk> from her final resting place , she rolls over on her back , exhausted .
She drinks in the night &apos;s air as if it were <unk> of water .
<unk> is in , on , and under every <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> looks like a beautiful <unk> , made out of dirt .
A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard .
A YOUNG <unk> <unk> stands behind the counter , waiting for a customer , when he sees something approaching through the restaurant &apos;s big picture window that makes him look twice .
Through the picture window , we see the Bride , emerge from the Texas night , and walk towards the diner looking for all the world like a <unk> tall female version of the <unk> character &quot; <unk> PEN . &quot;
With each of her <unk> , a smaller <unk> cloud of dust comes off her .
The dirty blonde , walks into the diner , sits on a stool at the counter directly across from the <unk> <unk> , and says ; I &apos;d like a glass of water .
<unk> the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am , driving full out on top of the desert &apos;s surface .
Spanish <unk> coming The car stops in front of Budd &apos;s camper .
She shuts off the The camper door opens , Budd squints outside through the bright gold , hot desert morning , at the <unk> Blonde Girl with Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd &apos;s tiny camper .
Elle sits a the kitchen table , a black suitcase by her feet .
Budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast <unk> , as he finishes telling the <unk> of last night .
I got to give it to ya Budd , that &apos;s a pretty fucked up way to die .
What &apos;s the name on the grave she &apos;s Budd turns on the <unk> blender , as Elle writes down the name <unk> Schultz on a small notepad , placing it back inside her pocket .
As the blender <unk> <unk> , Elle looks around and sees the Bride &apos;s Hanzo sword in its sheath , <unk> up against the <unk>
In the front room .
Budd shuts the blender off .
Can I look at the sword ?
That &apos;s my money in that black case , Well then , it &apos;s your sword now .
The tall blonde girl steps into the living room , takes the Hanzo sword , and sits back down on the kitchen chair .
She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath .
So this , is a Hattori Hanzo sword .
Budd answers as he fills up two former <unk> <unk> <unk> Bill tells me you once had one of How does this one compare to that If you &apos;re gonna compare a Hanzo sword , you compare it to every sword ever made -- wasn &apos;t made by Hattori Hanzo .

So , which &quot; R &quot; you filled with ?
They say the number one killer of got &apos;em a job to do , they tend to live a little longer so they can do and their enemies share the same gonna hafta face your enemy on the <unk> no more , which &quot; R &quot; are you filled with , <unk> or Regret ?

I &apos;m sure you do feel a little bit of both .
But I know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other .
The question was Elle looks right at him with her eye , and says ; Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol &apos; girl .
I never saw nobody <unk> Bill the way she <unk> Bill .
Bill <unk> think she was so damn smart .
I tried to tell him ... Bill , she &apos;s just smart for a blonde .
He looks over at Elle and <unk> .
She <unk> to the black suitcase by her feet .
He smiles and lifts it up on the table , <unk> it open .
Lying inside is a cool million , the thousand dollar bills are inside <unk> of a hundred thousand each .
At the sight of all this <unk> , Budd lets out a whistle .
He lifts a stack out of the bag , then another , then another ... and when he lifts the third stack out , he looks down and sees a BLACK <unk> <unk> <unk> underneath .
The Black Mamba opens its WIDE <unk> ... and LEAPS RIGHT AT ... STRIKING Budd in the face <unk> in <unk> <unk> Budd <unk> out of the kitchen chair onto the floor , bundles Elle takes a sip of her <unk> .
The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the <unk> .
Elle looks down , Budd lies on his back on the kitchen floor at her feet .
His face is already <unk> swollen and white as a sheet .
The <unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> venom makes a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> &apos;s nervous system .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry Budd , that was rude of me wasn &apos;t it ?
Budd -- I &apos;d like to introduce my friend , The Black Black Mamba -- this is Budd .
You know before I picked up that little fella , I looked him up on the &quot; ... In <unk> , the saying goes , in the <unk> , an <unk> can kill you .

The venom of a Black Mamba can kill a human in four hours , if say <unk> on the ankle or the thumb .
However , a bite to the face or <unk> can bring Now you should listen to this cause The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be -- You know I &apos;ve always liked that word <unk> , and I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a &quot; If not treated quickly with <unk> <unk> to human beings .
However , the Black Mamba can deliver as much as Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away .
She looks down at Budd at her feet , going through all the <unk> she just Now in these last <unk> minutes of life you have left , let me comes to that bitch , I gotta lotta &quot; R &apos;s &quot; in me .
Revenge is one .

Respect .
But right at this moment , the biggest &quot; R &quot; I feel , is Regret .
Regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met , met her end at the hands piece of shit like you .
The woman Budd , dying , watches from the floor as Elle takes out her cell phone and presses one button .
The other party comes on the line , but we never hear their side .
Budd tries to make a sound from the floor , Elle calmly places She put a Black Mamba in his Let me put it this way .
If you ever Austin , Texas .

And slowly turns her head to look back ..
Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver <unk> EYES ... ZOOM INTO <unk> CU &apos;s <unk> and <unk> , till Elle says ; The <unk> known as death <unk> , LEAPS at Elle .
Elle flicks her wrist slightly .
She doesn &apos;t even swing the The snake &apos;s head touches it , and is immediately <unk> ELLE &apos;S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand .
a <unk> of <unk> blood is on the silver steel .
Now that &apos;s what I call sharp .
Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am , starts up the ... she thinks she hears something ... she looks out her The dirty BLONDE BRIDE behind the wheel of her new , enormous red pickup truck , <unk> RIGHT <unk> HER ... behind the wheel , <unk> RIGHT <unk> HER ... <unk> THEME her <unk> drops open .

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of the black and gold sports car .
A smile with the slightest hint of satisfaction , spreads across her face .
She hops out of the truck and into Budd &apos;s camper .
As she walks through the door , Budd &apos;s dead , swollen body greets her .
As does her <unk> <unk> , dead on the floor She begins searching the camper , quickly , for something in <unk> .
We don &apos;t have the slightest <unk> what it could EX CU The BRIDE &apos;S EYE - Watching .

She sees a pair of cowboy boots .
<unk> one up and places the <unk> of the boot against the <unk> of her foot .
Her feet and this man &apos;s boot are around the same size .
She slips her dirty feet in them .
Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am , holding the Hanzo sword , looking like she &apos;s just been in a car <unk> .
A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face .
Luckily for her , not the side with the good eye .
The camper door swings open .
The Bride emerges from Budd &apos;s home , looking like a <unk> doll that &apos;s been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard , carrying a Hanzo sword .
Every <unk> creating a cloud of dust .
The two women , each carrying a samurai sword , face each other A <unk> smile spreads across Elle &apos;s face .

TWO SHOT : The TWO WOMEN <unk> stand their ground , STRIKING and <unk> ... When they stop , no one &apos;s been touched .

BLOOD begins to <unk> <unk> out of a slice in Elle &apos;s neck only a quarter of an inch long .
The Blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a <unk> RED <unk> , like that of an <unk> can , we even HEAR the slight <unk> <unk> .
Elle feels nothing .
She turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray , and sees the blood <unk> her like air from a <unk> .
She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray , it &apos;s immediately <unk> IN RED .
As her blood continues to escape , both women look across each The effect is that Elle Driver is a <unk> and her life is <unk> before both their very eyes .
And now looking across at each other , the two women see the other for the first time , not as <unk> , or <unk> , or as <unk> , or as Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up ... She falls to her knees in front of The Bride .... ... then as she dies , she leans the side of her head against The Bride &apos;s standing body .
Her blood runs down The Bride &apos;s leg .
As she passes on , Elle gently wraps her arms around the The Bride &apos;s hands go down to Elle &apos;s long blonde hair , and begins gently stroking it , <unk> her pain as she <unk> .
Only in death do they find the <unk> that could have The Bride standing , Elle on her knees , the desert surrounds The Bride has finished <unk> Elle .
She sticks a <unk> <unk> wood cross in the ground as a marker .
Then using her <unk> the name &quot; <unk> DRIVER &quot; on the cross .
Then drives away in the big red pickup .

As he heads out the patio , he tells her ; around the house , if you would .
He exits the patio , then turns around and pops his head back You know I just had a great idea .
Take the <unk> , and spread the <unk> on the bed I just got for her .
That &apos;d be a nice thing to come home to , wouldn &apos;t it , a bed of Oh , she &apos;ll love that Mr. Bill .

He yells at it in Spanish ; Get the fuck off the car , <unk> , The <unk> in front of Bill &apos;s <unk> home open , and his silver Porsche hits the streets running .
A SUSPENSE THEME PLAYS OVER THE SHOTS of The Bride &apos;s <unk> every time we cut to it .

Let &apos;s go in the other room ...
The camera creeps along a wall , coming to a corner .
We move past it , and see down a hall .
At the end of the hall is a bathroom .
The bathroom door is <unk> closed , <unk> our view .
Mr.
Pink is obscured , but Mr. White is in view .
What the fuck am I doing here ?
I felt funny about this job right off .
As soon as I felt it I should said &quot; No thank you &quot; , and walked .
But I never fucking listen .
Every time I ever got burned buying weed , I always knew the guy wasn &apos;t right .
I just felt it .
But I wanted to believe him .
If he &apos;s not <unk> &apos; to me , and it really is Thai stick , then whoa baby .

As he gets closer he sees Mr. Orange is out .
He runs over to So , is he dead or what ?

Pink &apos;s <unk> , we slowly ZOOM in to a CLOSEUP of <unk> we can trust Joe , how we gonna get in touch with him ?
He &apos;s supposed to be here , but he ain &apos;t , which is making me nervous about being here .
Even if Joe is on the up and up , he &apos;s probably not gonna be that happy with us .
Joe planned a robbery , but he &apos;s got a blood bath on his hands now .
Dead cops , dead Christ !
I tend to doubt he &apos;s gonna have a lot of <unk> for our <unk> .
If I was him , I &apos;d try and put as much distance between me and this Before you got here , Mr. Orange was askin &apos; me to take him to a hospital .
Now I don &apos;t like turning him over to the cops , but if we don &apos;t , he &apos;s dead .
He <unk> me to do it .
I told him to hold off till Joe got here .
Well Joe ain &apos;t gettin &apos; here .
We &apos;re on our own .
Now , I don &apos;t know a goddamn body who can help him , so if Well , I guess we drop him off at the hospital .
Since he don &apos;t know nothin &apos; about us , I say it &apos;s his decision .
Well , he knows a little about me .
You didn &apos;t tell him your name , did I told him my first name , and where There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr.
Pink , then I told him where I was from a few days ago .

There &apos;s a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange has The man you killed was just <unk> from prison .
He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items .
